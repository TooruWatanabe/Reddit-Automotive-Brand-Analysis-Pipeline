cars,Why did the Big 3 never go beyond 10 cylinders post-1940?,"Basically what I meant to ask was that why have America’s Big 3 never went beyond 10 cylinders, when it came to production spec engines.

They used to make V12 and V16 powered luxobarges back in the 30s and 40s, but the last American car with a V16 came out in 1940 and the last American car with a V12 in 1948.

Both BMW & Mercedes had V12 powered saloons in the 80s and 90s, even in the 2010s. Mercedes still has the V12 in the S680.

Heck, even Toyota made a V12 powered saloon in the 90s. The same Toyota which also made cars like the Corolla.

There were concepts like the Ford GT90, the Ford Indigo, Cadillac Cien and the Chrysler ME412, which had V12s, and the Cadillac Sixteen with a functional V16.

In Chrysler’s case, they were still with Mercedes in the partnership and Mercedes didn’t green light the ME412 due to fear of cannibalization of their own sports car sales.

But I’m pretty sure GM & Ford could’ve given the Europeans a run for their money.",Toyota,59,0.89,2025-09-20 11:51:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1nlp5e0/why_did_the_big_3_never_go_beyond_10_cylinders/

you can throw two cars on top of each other to see the real size difference, or check a truck's turning radius to see if you'll need to do a 5-point turn just to turn around in your driveway. Visualization stuff you can't tell from a spec sheet.

cars,[ThrottleHouse Karston] 35th Anniversary Mazda Miata text review.,"Credit to Karston Chong from Throttlehouse for this writeup of his experience with the Anniversary edition Miata @Karstonc on instagram:

""The 35th Anniversary Edition MX-5 reminds me of the GR86 Hakone Edition - an already well-liked sports car that shoots up in desirability based solely on the colour scheme. Artisan Red Metallic, silver wheels, tan interior and beige roof; simple but elegant. Keener eyes will also spot the paint-matched AC vent trims, embossed headrests, and badging - but otherwise this drives like the ND3 GT it’s based on.

The 2.0L is torquey down-low, and pulls consistently to the redline, although it’s a bit quiet to match the fun nature of the MX-5 (aftermarket sound tube or exhaust have proven effective).

This classic short-shifter is still the best in the game. Not only are the throws short and crisp, it’s consistent. Never did it reject a gate, nor feel crunchy or different from the shift before.

The ND3’s new EPAS system adds weight and definition to the on-centre feel and initial turn-in, but is not dramatic. I had a quick back-to-back with an ND2 to remind myself of its slightly ambiguous on-centre and weightless turn-in. The improvement is subtle and welcome, but steering still feels slightly overboosted and lacks road texture.

Ride quality is good, road imperfections are noticeable, but it never crashes over bumps nor affects body control. Signature MX-5 body-roll still exists, heightening the fun of driving below 7/10ths but step beyond that and it manages to feel planted and confident through corners.

The ‘Kinematic Posture Control’ is neat - a ‘22 software enhancement that brakes the inside rear wheel in high-G cornering to reduce body-roll. I’ve noticed it to activate in aggressive 90 degree corners, and engage at the point of turn-in paired with heavy throttle. The inside rear feels like it ‘drags’ to pull down that corner to reduce roll on the opposite corner (outside front). It works but feels unnatural and unnecessary. I found myself expecting for it to engage, or surprised by its pronounced activation. Defeating KPC and T/C altogether became my preference.

Lastly the stock seats still lack bolstering and adjustability, but until they offer the Recaros in the same tan finish, this 35th Anniversary Edition would be my desired spec of MX-5.""",Ram,74,0.87,2025-09-16 07:56:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1ni3ldp/throttlehouse_karston_35th_anniversary_mazda/

Mark and Jack take another look at r/cars' 2nd favorite car to hate on after the upcoming prelude. They talk about it a lot, but I think the price is really the only downside. It's a great formula, it performs well, it just hasn't kept up with the market, which would be fine if it was more affordable.

cars,Autotrader.com scam where prospective buyer insists seller get a report from an obscure web site that is a knock-off Carfax.,"Perhaps this is already widely known, I have not come across it before. I am selling an SUV privately on Autotrader (meaning, I'm an individual not a dealer). It has been listed less than 24 hours. I was contacted by a prospective buyer, whose identity was verified through Autotrader. They expressed interest in coming to see the vehicle the next day with their husband, asked about times and a location. Then they started lobbying hard that they simply must have a report from [www.carcresh.com](http://www.carcresh.com) before they would come see it.

They'd send me messages through Autotrader like:

*This is an official document that contains the complete histry and all the important records of the vehicle. It provides detailed information about every aspect of the vehicle , so you can make an informed and confident decision.*

and

*My experience with Car fax wasn’t good. I rely on CC Records they are very detailed and easy to understand. I used them when selling my previous car. I am satisfied with CC Records.*

and

*Before coming , I want to see what I'm getting. The reports aren't just for me you can share them with anyone.*

When I told them I wasn't buying a report from this site I've never heard of, I got back:

*I understand your concern, but this is an official site that provides detailed vehicle records. If you’re worried about the cost, I can cover it with the final payment.*

This wasn't a legitimate prospective buyer, it was just some idiot trying to get me to pay $40 or more for a Temu version of a Carfax report  (and expose my credit card information, I'm sure).

cars,The American pullback from EVs is bad for America's future (My opinion),"Hey all. 

So I love ICE engine cars...esp sports cars. But I've slowly come around to the idea that EVs are better for the future in terms of moving away from fossil fuels and the resulting emissions. Now I'm open to having something like an Kia EV9 or BMW i4 as a primary car while continuing to keep my ICE Golf R as the fun, vroom vroom option. And it's not a big engine so I don't feel that bad. 

There's no doubt that EVs had issues and things like tax money subsidizing fancy EVs was problematic. The car industry also went too deep into high end expensive EVs and not enough Leafs and Bolts. Hybrids continue to play a crucial bridging role too. But all that said, I think its best for the environment to move to EVs but perhaps keep a carve-out for performance models as those sell in small numbers and 5000 Mustangs don't have the impact that 500,000 RAV4s do. 

I know we are sort of thrilled about the return of V8s (recent announcements) but this is a bad step back and will hurt America and the environment in the long term. It will also mean that American car makers will fall back behind European, SK and Chinese car makers who will continue to innovate in the EV market. In many ways, I feel that this is grasping for a time that is now firmly in the past. Dodge just cancelled the electric Ram. These big full-size trucks need to become electric in my opinion. 

Thoughts? And this is just my opinion...I'm looking for a debate, not a personal-attacks war. ",BMW,0,0.49,2025-09-15 20:43:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1nhm7tm/the_american_pullback_from_evs_is_bad_for/

And today lo and behold, I was greeted with a “**Hybrid system fault, Stop and Call McLaren Service Center**” error in my car as I unplugged it from the charger. The car won’t start and even the parking brake wouldn’t disengage because it uses the 12V battery, which is part of the hybrid system
apparently (it’s charged by the high voltage lithium ion battery).

Good thing I’m close to a McLaren dealer and I have other cars.

FWIW I loved the car so much I put 1700 miles on it in just 7 weeks and it’s sensational even as a daily driver.

Propulsion comes from a single-speed gearbox connected to the traction motor. Honda’s system doesn’t move the Civic using the gas engine and electric motor at the same time, but the gas engine provides power to the wheels through a clutch when it’s most efficient, like at highway cruising speeds.”",Honda,45,0.74,2025-09-11 05:10:41,https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-new-honda-prelude-doesnt-have-a-transmission-heres-why

cars,BMW M240 Review after 1 year + Why I moved to a Tesla Model 3,"TLDR: I agree with Hagerty's / Jason Camisa on the Model 3 Perf vs M3.  [https://youtu.be/vCPlZl6xJq4?t=1121](https://youtu.be/vCPlZl6xJq4?t=1121)

Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/GtBaFN1](https://imgur.com/a/GtBaFN1)

2024 M240, portimao blue, cognac interior, 792m wheels, shadowline package.

**Context:**

I ordered a 2024 M240 in \~January 2024, picked it up mid May, and drove it as my daily for about 15 months before selling it.

I’ve been “into cars” since I was a teen, and had a few fast cars along the way. But in my late 20s / early 30s, life and practicality got in the way and I had a (boring but fine) Impreza hatchback (non WRX.) I’d been passively eyeing a replacement for a years when I decided to finally get something.

My key wants included:

* Didn't need ""extremely fast"", but fast-ish.
* Really good day-to-day livable technology
* An interior space that I enjoyed

**Contenders**

Before ultimately picking the 240, my shortlist included:

* Miata: Love it, but my commute is highway and that’s not where it’s ideal. I wanted more power. If I lived up a backroad though? Oh man, million percent yes.
* Polestar 2: Actually really like the look, and I like EVs in general, but their tech stack was terrible IMO and completely disqualified the car.
* New Nissan Z: Was browsing right as it debuted. LOVE the exterior, hate the interior, hate the price
* Audi S5: Like the look, like the interior, felt more “businessman car” than “performance car.” Nice but boring.
* X3 M40: A strange contender, I know, but it would have fit my lifestyle needs well. One drive though, and I instantly remembered why I like cars over any SUV variant. I can see why people like it though.

**Power/Drivetrain**

The B58 engine is as good as people say. The car is extremely well suited for day-to-day driving, and the automatic transmission feels completely dialed in for it. I get the appeal of a manual, but this chassis and drivetrain make sense with the automatic. For most people, there’s no practical reason to “upgrade” to an M2—this thing is already more power than you can realistically use on public roads. Sport / Sport + modes were obviously sharper, but what I enjoyed the most was the on-top power even in Comfort. Also, the B58 gets all the attention, but the ZF8 transmission deserves exactly as much. They’re an extremely good pairing. You simply never had hesitation, gear confusion, or rough starts. For an ICE driveline, it was extremely good.

Highway acceleration is strong, passing is effortless, and the car felt very stable at speed. It (allegedly) was very happy to sit and cruise at highway ++ speeds while feeling like 60mph. Acceleration is always fun, but at-speed stability is something I personally appreciate a lot, and it’s great at that. It’s also (relatively) quiet, especially if you compare it to on-paper-similarities like the Mustang or Z. It’s just got more refinement.

**Handling, Steering & Driving Dynamics**

For a car with 19-inch wheels, comfort is impressive. The adaptive suspension is a must-have in my opinion—the comfort mode makes daily driving tolerable, while sport mode firms things up when you want to push it. In the US we don’t have an option to not have adaptive, but I know non-US cars do, and I’d option it without question. Comfort is good for most of the time, but too soft for sporty driving, and sport is (imo) way too stiff for everyday runs to the grocery store.

Steering is a mixed bag. It’s absolutely not as bad as people online make it out to be, but it’s also not inspiring. It gets hate for being electric, but I’ve driven electric power steering cars with better feel. There’s really very little off-center weight, and it does feel numb compared to some older hydraulic setups. Having said that, I think many people online judge this for how it (hypothetically) would work on a track, and I’m sorry, but the absolute vast majority of these aren’t track cars, they’re dailies, and the steering works and feels well in that regard.

And feel aside, the handling itself is very good (for a performance street car). Traction control and dynamic traction settings are very well balanced. With xDrive, the car feels planted but still lets the rear step out a little if you want. Of course, RWD is an option if you want it.

It’s a meme at this point, but: I agree that the weight is well hidden in most situations. The only time you really feel it is under very hard braking.

**Comfort & Practicality**

The front seats and general driver experience are great. But being honest, this is effectively a two-seater. The sloping roof and minimal legroom make the back seats borderline unusable for adults. It’s not quite as bad as a Porsche 911, but the same principle applies: it’s best treated as a two-seater with emergency storage in the back.

Trunk is fine.

I got the cognac interior color, which I LOVE. Highly recommended. Annoyingly, BMW reserves cooled/ventilated seats for its very top tier ($$$) models. I’ve had a car with cooled seats before (and my new one does now too) and I’d personally absolutely take ventilated seats over heated seats, and it really bugged me not having it.

**Tech & Interior**

Contentious part: I know many people complain about BMW’s iDrive 8+ and lack of physical controls, but I’ve had the opposite experience. I set my climate to 70°F on day one and literally haven’t touched it since—the system just works. In a year of ownership, I’ve been comfortable in all seasons without fiddling.

BMW’s infotainment is excellent in real-world use. Yes, reviewers online love to scroll through every obscure BMW app in their reviews, but in daily driving, you just start the car, Android Auto loads instantly, music starts playing, and everything works smoothly. In a year, maybe 3–5 times Android Auto didn’t load properly, but otherwise it’s been seamless. My extremely hot take is that this is a system that looks bad when you watch Tedward/Topher scroll through 60 apps, but in the real world, it is extremely reliable, gets out of your way, and just works. In particular, BMW’s auto climate is basically magic.

One negative: BMW, like every brand (other than Tesla) has a GARBAGE voice control. Android Auto is extremely good (Hold steering button, “Play \_\_\_ on spotify”) but you’d never use voice to do car functions, even though it technically can.

BMWs adaptive cruise was extremely good, as was their phone-as-key implementation. App itself was better than 90% probably of car apps. Wireless android auto was extremely reliable (\~5 disconnects in my ownership time.)

BMW’s adaptive LED headlights were GREAT. Nighttime visibility is something that’s basically never talked about on car reviews, and their adaptive matrix lights worked incredibly well. I literally never got high-beam flashed when using it and you can watch the lights “cut out” the oncoming / ahead car. Wild stuff and very much an IYKYK. Lighting tech is far better than most (US) cars have.

  
**Random little things**

BMW had the upgraded HK audio. It was good, but I didn't think it deserved to be the 'upgraded' version. It's what I would expect baseline to be. But to that end, if you buy one, you should avoid base audio. Performance non-runflat tires were the way to go, but if you get a flat (as I did,) you're getting a tow, as there's no other real option. BMW does this TINY little thing with the backup parking sensors where it plays the beeping alert from the side of the car that the object is on! Super freaking obvious once I realized it, and I nice little improvement. 

 **Why I sold it for a Tesla Model 3**

Now, I drive a 25 dual motor quicksilver model 3. [Yup, looks like a Tesla. ](https://imgur.com/a/99ui22b)

This is gonna be a weird take, and many probably won’t understand / agree / believe my stance but:

After a year, I just…. Kinda felt like the M240 was wasted. I always thought I wanted a performance coupe, but actually having one and living with it… I just felt like it was too much potential with not enough actuality. Put another way: 95% of my driving was just commuting on the highway in \~55mph traffic. Yes, passing power was great, yes onramps were fun, but it was like…. 4 seconds of fun at a time. Admitedly, this is a super privileged stance to take, because dropping back down to a car that is \~200hp would make me feel really underpowered and frustrated, but I just really grew to feel like the 240 was just more than I needed. In mountain bike terms: I was overbiked for the trail I was on. Some people (even past me) would have loved the extra capacity, but I just grew to really feel all the time like, “I’m just not enjoying this car as much as I want to.” When you got to do “fun BMW things,” it was GREAT. Sitting in traffic, it was fine.

An ultra spicy take, but I have always enjoyed driving EVs and knew that the 240 would likely be the last ICE car I bought, but I moved that timeline up a notch. I decided to drive a 2025 Model 3 on a whim and basically knew on the first drive I was gonna switch. The Model 3 is faster \*in the real world\* than the 240 by virtue of being silent, absolutely looking like ‘traffic,’ and all the EV things. This isn’t an ICE vs EV post, but I’m just sharing that: For me, having the power of the Model 3 instantly and always on tap (+ the knowledge that I live in the most expensive gas and cheapest electricity part of the country) means I feel like I enjoy the Model 3 more, in more situations. The 240 would beat the model 3 in launch control, but the 3 is faster in most real world passing power situations, etc. The BMW can match the 'instant torque' feeling but only in sport + mode, otherwise there's a delay that EVs just never have.

The BMW is far superior to the Tesla for the 5-10% of times you really get to properly enjoy it as a sports coupe. The Tesla is a net superior driving experience the 90% of time I’m going from home to work or to meet a friend. It’s an extremely easy car to blend into your life. As for build quality, both the BMW and Tesla had some rattles and squeaks that were covered under warranty. Interior of the BMW felt a biiiiiit nicer overall, but then there are also things the Tesla does much better too. It’s far closer than most people think online. **The steering feel of the Tesla is absolutely, unequivocally better (not just weighting, but feedback.)** Tesla's voice control is TOP tier. Yes, they're often driven as ""traffic,"" but even the non-perf models drive extremely well. If you haven't hustled one on a backroad, then you should go try it.

**Wrap up / Random Thoughts**

The M240 was exactly what I hoped for: a car that combines serious speed, daily comfort, great tech, and real-world livability. As a balanced daily driver with performance, it’s outstanding. I fully recommend it and I am very happy to have owned it.

Having said that, the 240 was like a great friend who always interrupted you with things you wanted to hear (but maybe not right now.) It made its presence very known on my drives, and that grew to not be what I wanted. I guess I’m just super old (at 35,) but I really appreciate the subtlety and daily livability of the Model 3 (or EVs in general, for that matter.) The Model 3 is faster in the real world and the low CG makes it a really fun experience to play around with, and then when you’re commuting, it does its job very well.

I’m fully prepared for everyone to hate this choice, but as someone who actually bought these cars, I have zero regrets. The 240 is a fantastic car, but for me, the real equation was: do I want a performance daily coupe? I think I’ve grown to understand that I don’t. If money was infinite, I’d go further on each end of the spectrum: A really fast sedan (Think, Lucid) + a more dedicated sports car (718 GTS, etc.).

I can already predict the replies: ""Who sells a B58 for a Model 3? Congrats, you're traffic. Huge downgrade, you're gonna regret it. Terrible take. Unsurprising that the person who doesn't want physical controls swaps an M240 for a Tesla."" Yeah, that's all fine. You don't have to get it. But as someone who actually bought, owned, and used these, it's the right choice for me. The car is a tool to acheive what I want, it's not the end goal itself. And the Model 3 does a better job of that.

And if you think the 240 would fit into your life? Buy it. Great car. Not for me.

cars,Previewing the production Ioniq 3 hatchback (MotorTrend),"This is Hyundai's Concept Three, which previews a new small EV called the Ioniq 3 intended for the European market—although if we whine enough, maybe they'll bring it to the States, eh? We really hope that happens, because this thing is super, super rad. Let's dive in.

The chunky Three is a hatchback that measures 168.7 inches long, 76.4 inches wide, and 56.2 inches tall; that makes it about the same size as a Toyota GR Corolla hatchback, although the Hyundai is six inches shorter overall, about four inches wider, and has a roof an inch closer to the ground. Even still, its wheelbase of 107.2 inches is more than three inches longer that the Toyota's, which should translate to more interior space. The magic of EVs and their more compact powertrains, we're promised, gives this B-segment exterior C-segment roominess. The concept appears to have concept-style rear-hinged rear doors with no B-pillar, but we expect the production model will get four conventional doors.

The styling is sensational, a sort of amalgamation of the Hyundai Ioniq 5's sharp-edged, ’80s-tastic pixelated vibe and the Genesis GV60's squat plumpness. The exterior is painted a matte Tungsten Gray—a familiar hue among the Hyundai brands—while the interior is done up in gray, silver, and Moonbeam Yellow, a highlighter shade that somehow actually works even if we'd probably get jeans stains on it almost immediately. ""IONIQ"" lettering on the liftgate identifies the Three as a member of Hyundai's electrified family. Don't count on the yellow-highlighter tinting on the greenhouse glass, but we wouldn't be shocked if the see-through yellow ""active spoiler"" made production (perhaps shrunken slightly for aerodynamics, though being transparent means it's not a visibility problem).
Inside, interesting shapes and textures abound, including a grooved floor and door cards, large X-shaped appliqués on the sides of the retro-futuristic headrests, which look like they could be couch cushions on Space Station V from 2001: A Space Odyssey. More sci-fi influence is found in the ""screens,"" which are formed from cubes that display all sorts of physical and digital messages, symbols, and lights. At the debut, they pulsated with orange lighting reminiscent of special effects from the original Star Trek.

Illuminated ""Thrillseeker"" (passenger side) and ""Troublemaker"" (driver side) wording on the seatbacks make it pretty clear this thing is meant to kick ass and quicken pulses. A cute, slightly impish ghost acts as a sort of theme in various places, appearing not only on the rooftop shark-fin antenna but also animated on a monochromatic circular screen on the end of the dashcap. Baseball stitching on the window sills and center console adds a bit of luxury detailing.
When the Three concept becomes the Ioniq 3 (""one year from now"" we were told at the unveiling) we could see it using the Ioniq 5's base 225-hp motor for propulsion, perhaps in tandem with its 63-kWh battery pack. If so, a range figure of 275 miles isn't out of the question. Of course, now that we've seen the Three, the real question is how much power a Hyundai Ioniq 3 N would have? Fingers crossed it's a number that starts with a 5.",Toyota,30,0.85,2025-09-10 12:10:42,https://www.motortrend.com/news/hyundai-concept-3-ioniq-hatchback-ev-first-look

cars,Mercedes-Benz’s chief of design during top gear interview spoke on BMW’s & Audi’s latest designs,"Not all of the quotes are  word for word in order to make Gorden’s answers more comprehensible because some of what he said was pretty strangely verbalized.

BMW Key notes:

“What BMW did with the iX3’s interior? When I first saw the conceptual version of the car upon its unveiling I noticed that information that would be rather vital to the driver was all the way at the bottom of the screen.

Which of course would make it hard to read, everything also appeared smaller so it made it more distracting then it already might’ve been to someone. So to help make the operating experience easier for drivers they put a touch screen into the production version,

which was a pretty conventional but complicated solution because there’s vital information at different levels which I don’t think is intuitive. They think it’s progressive and I think they must love it or otherwise they wouldn’t have done it but I’m not in favor of it”

Audi Key Notes:

“The interior of the Audi Concept C looks like it was designed in 1995. A notable amount of design choices in it are a bit too known and there is too little tech in it. I have always claimed that I am a big fan of of heavily hyper analog designed interiors but you can’t ignore a screen.

When you have a screen that’s small in a car that isn’t small a message is being sent to everyone in the car that they’re actually in a small car. With that being said though since this is just a concept car and one that will be a part of a very niche segment anyway it won’t really matter if production version ends up having that interior anyway. For a mainstream though, going back to all switches is not going to work for Audi.


The next quote whole is word by word what gorden said at a time during the interview. It lets you know what manner he verbalized himself with.

“I believe that with large language models, we will see more voice operation. It is now working perfectly. I think that will be the future, but even so you want to have a visual reference on the screen, or you might want to watch a movie and stuff like that. So yeah, you need big screens.”",BMW,77,0.9,2025-09-10 00:10:32,https://www.topgear.com/car-news/interview/merc-design-boss-audi-concept-c-interior-looks-it-was-designed-1995

cars,Japanese Reviewers have been driving Pre-Production Honda Preludes,"[https://youtu.be/1eM2FO2NVAo?si=N3ctPqS5XerJ2USc](https://youtu.be/1eM2FO2NVAo?si=N3ctPqS5XerJ2USc)

[https://youtu.be/62AVQp3zNKw?si=FJdlbvpbBA6lsskZ](https://youtu.be/62AVQp3zNKw?si=FJdlbvpbBA6lsskZ)

I haven't seen this mentioned here yet, but Japan has had far more access to the Prelude for whatever reason. So far the impressions seem positive. You can use YouTube's translation features if you don't speak Japanese.

Some highlights:

* The car corners nicely. There's no hard understeer like you'd usually expect from a front-drive car. The suspension setup is fantastic. The transmission feels like a DCT. It also can use the brakes to help with turn-in.
* Apparently the car is setup so that the battery provides 50Kw but the engine has to rev to get maximum power for the motor.
* ""Its a Civic Type-R for adults"". He thinks the Type-R is more fun, but the Prelude is less harsh.
* The engine and transmission are tuned to be more fun. There's fake engine sound from the speakers. He also noticed that the engine kind of anticipates your next move (for example, revving up as you prepare to exit a corner)
* He compared the experience to something you'd expect from a luxury coupe, not a more practical vehicle. Its a car with two personalities. It can be sporty, but also pretty comfortable without feeling flimsy or too soft.
* GT mode seems to be the default with Sport mode being the fun setting and Comfort being, well, comfortable. He notes that GT and comfort don't seem different unless you drive the car for a while.
* In Japan, the CTR and Prelude can be had at the exact same price.

From the test drive videos I've seen, people seem to like it. I'm still predicting that this will be an uncommon car. With it being priced against the CTR, I don't think they'll sell that many and they know that going into it.

  
EDIT: Mugen is developing some aftermarket parts for the new Prelude that should be available in 2026: Carbon front lip, Carbon Mirror caps, Carbon diffuser, Carbon spoiler, interior mats, some kind of stiffening kit, and an exhaust.

Very interesting engine tear down, and this video shows why the 3 cylinder ecoboost engine continues to be ridiculous. 

In the video, this engine has 70,000 miles on it and experienced a failure, when the presetor gets to the oil pump belt and inspects it, he notes that is is severely cracked/rotten. The engine couldn't be any more than 5 years old. Completely fine if this were easily serviceable, but during tear down it is pretty obvious there is absolutely no other way to remove this belt other than taking the crankshaft out of the engine.

Honestly this is insane, its like they are intentionally putting a shitty rubber band in the middle of the engine to make sure that it fails after so many years and mechanically totals it just barely outside of the warranty period, otherwise this engine looks really nicely designed on the inside.",,103,0.87,2025-09-08 02:34:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1nb2jdy/how_much_to_replace_my_oil_pump_belt_the_customer/
cars,My extensive 2020 BMW Z4 M40i Review,"**Intro**

I’ve been in the market for an “easy” road trip car my criteria has been as follows: 

-Comfortable over long distances

-Easy to drive around town or unfamiliar places
 
-A reasonable amount of storage space/practicality 

-“Special” without grabbing too much unwanted attention 

-Has adaptive cruise control

-A 2 seater or 2+2

-As fun and as performance oriented as possible

The BMW Z4 M40i looked to hit a lot of of these points on paper and considering how much cheaper they are than say a Porsche or Mercedes AMG-GT, I decided to rent one and give it a go! 

I’ve driven quite a few other vehicles and my thoughts are informed with all of these vehicles in mind. That list includes: 

C5 Corvette, V6 5th Gen Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, C8 Corvette Z06, C8 Corvette E-Ray, 2018 Mercedes AMG-GT, Porsche Taycan Turbo, Taycan GTS, Taycan 4S, 997.2 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, 718 Cayman S, Porsche 992.1 Carrera S Cabriolet Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Ford Focus RS, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400, the Lotus Elise, McLaren 720S, McLaren Artura,  and the 2017 Acura NSX.


**Power**

**Excellent power delivery**

The most immediate thing that stands out about the Z4 is its excellent power delivery. I’ve seen a lot of people sing the praises of the B58 engine and I’m now a true believer! As you put your foot into the throttle you are asked “how much torque do you want?” and the car just gives it to you basically all the way up the redline. I’ve driven some really solid turbocharged cars, McLaren 720S, McLaren Artura, AMG-GT, Acura NSX, Giulia QV, 911 Turbo, 911 Carrera S. To be honest on the butt dyno the M40i feels about as fast as an AMG-GT, Giulia QV, 911 Carrera S, and about 90% as strong as an Acura NSX. I will also say the Z4 feels like it pulls distinctly stronger than say a C8 Stingray. 

Now objectively speaking these other vehicles are all of course faster, but I really do feel like you get a very comparable amount of power delivery to some proper high-end vehicles and that’s a huge win for the Z4. 

The other important thing to note is the Z4 M40i has no problem putting its power down consistently. Now a lot of this accomplished through clever differential tuning where BMW essentially “smooths” out the the initial throttle response for the first few miles per hour until the car has enough traction to give you the full beans. In practice this feels like a low amount of turbo lag, but within the context of the car’s personality and overall driving experience it works really well!

**Thrust all the time**
One of the things I enjoyed about the BMW Z4 M40i is its ability to seemingly provide “thrust” and “torque” in seemingly any gear. On the streets 1-4 all pull beautifully, but you can even get a decent shove going in 5th. On the highway 6th and 7th pull decently strong and you only really get into overdrive territory in 8th. Again, there’s seemingly no limit to the amount of power available to you in the Z4. Is it as powerful or as “peaky” as I have experienced in some other cars? No, but you can always rely on the Z4 to start pushing you forward with a distinct sense of urgency.

**Fun without going to jail** 

The Z4 has this wonderful ability to let you bury your foot in the throttle, feel a tremendous amount of torque, see the road and your surroundings start to speed up, bury your foot into the throttle even more, and still not be in jail territory. What’s important to note though, is in this sensation of speed you’re still driving a decently powerful and fast vehicle, so it’s not some “slow car fast, driving an under powered car is funner” silliness. I will also say the overall responsiveness, impression of speed and “thrust”, feels very comparable to that of a higher end turbocharged car. So you get the best of all worlds when you accelerate with an M40i. The car is properly quick, so you don’t feel like you’re driving some underpowered thing, it’s about 90% of the experience as a high-end turbocharged car so you’re not missing out on a whole lot of goodness there, and you can accelerate for a very long time without totally breaking the speed limit. This makes for a very enjoyable street experience. You’re just having proper fun the whole time without really worrying about putting yourself or other folks in danger. 

**Rowdy but muted exhaust** 

I found the Z4’s exhaust to be a little underwhelming, but also very rowdy at the same time. Cold starts on the Z4 leave a lot to be desired. There’s no “shout” no “roar to life” you don’t even really feel any engine vibration, it just kind of tickles itself on and to me it feels very Honda or Toyota appliance car-esque. In sports mode you do start to hear more induction noise, but it does feel pumped in through the speakers and the volume level honestly doesn’t feel like it’s in line with the amount of speed/torque you are experiencing.

You do however get one of the most aggressive pops and bangs exhaust tunes ever. I mean seriously some of the pops sound like a grenade just went off. But because the actually exhaust note is so muted, it kind of just sounds like the Z4 M40i is just making pops and bangs and burbles all of the time. 

The good news is in canyon driving or in tunnels you do hear the exhaust a lot more prominently and it is a decent sound that can be enjoyed on a properly spirited drive. However around town the pops and bangs feel a little too aggressive and “let’s piss everyone off”, but the normal exhaust mode is very quiet and muted. So I’d say the Z4 needs a “middle” no pops and bangs exhaust mode, and it also needs just a little more exhaust note making its way into the cabin to keep up with the volume of the pops and bangs. 

**Fun and responsive transmission** 

A big worry of mine was how responsive the ZF 8 speed would be. I had tried a ZF 8 speed in a Giulia QV, and it was great for an auto box, but did delay a bit on up shift and down shift. In the Z4 M40i I think the ZF 8-speed is incredible. 

First off, up shifts and down shifts basically happen on demand. I’ve driven only DCT’s for the past few years and I had no qualms whatsoever with the ZF 8 speed’s responsiveness. You’d only be able to tell the difference if you drove the car back to back with a higher end DCT, but on its own the ZF 8 speed shifts when you want it to. 

Critically, the transmission shoves you on upshifts and jolts as you down shift. I really enjoy this behavior on ICE vehicles because it makes them actually fun to drive. I would say a C8 Z06 shoves you a bit harder, and the McLaren Artura/720S feel a lot “crisper” in how they shift, but the “fun” factor in how the Z4 shifts far exceeds that of a 911 Carrera S, Acura NSX, AMG GT, and 718 Cayman S. 

One other thing to note, using the gear selector to shift on the Z4 is properly enjoyable. The throw is exactly what it should be and the way the car shifts and behaves as you pull the lever feels like a really good match for the throw motion. I find folks who use the gear selector to shift to be a bit “silly” especially on Porsches since the throw and feedback are a bit “meh”, but in the Z4 it works and is enjoyable! 

**Handling:** 

Handling is honestly where I started to notice the performance difference on the Z4. Compared to a lot of the other vehicles I have driven, the Z4 felt like a less capable handler, but as I drove it more and more its handling characteristics started to make sense to me. 

**Less sharp than you expect but still fun.** 

In general the handling of the Z4 M40i doesn’t present itself as some super dialed in “sharp” vehicle. It feels a little more “normal car” on its face, even in sports plus mode. What this generally translates to when driving is the vehicle is often telling you when to brake, you do feel a decent amount of body roll, and you’re just not going to be able to pull off some “physics defying” turns like you’d be able to in other vehicles. 

That being said, I noticed a lot of these handling “deficiencies” in my more “normal” driving scenarios, when I got the M40i onto a canyon road was able to have plenty of fun with it. On a canyon the front isn’t nearly as sharp as you generally want it to be, but you have plenty of confidence with the rear so as long as you do a little bit of early braking into a corner, you can still carry plenty of speed. Likewise the steering tends to feel surprisingly precise at canyon carving speeds, and the suspension does have a tendency to feel “lively” at speed while still being plenty comfortable. This collectively gives a pretty nice sense of engagement on a canyon and you do feel like you’re still able to drive the car decently fast, 

**Nicely weighted steering** 

The steering weight and feedback on the Z4 is surprisingly nice. You get a healthy amount of road texture through the wheel, off center movements feel fairly natural, and as a whole the steering feels pretty well calibrated. To me the steering rack felt almost hyrdaulic-esque in its characteristics (despite obviously being an electric rack), but I will also say that the steering isn’t quite the same highlight as it is in a McLaren, Lotus, or Porsche. 

**Planted rear end** 

A big plus for the Z4 M40i is you basically never have to worry about the rear end. I find this to be huge because it means you can actually use the throttle when driving the car hard without fear of the rear breaking loose or losing traction. I’d contrast this against say a C5-C7 Corvette where you’re constantly worried about what the rear end is doing and you’re always light with the throttle. 

**Lacking front-end grip**

The Z4 does noticeably lack front end grip and generally feels prone to understeer. What this translates into when driving is you just don’t have the confidence to pull off what I would call “feats of handling” like you would with a more performance oriented vehicle. For instance you’re likely not going to be able to dive bomb a hairpin turn at a light, or have the confidence to take a freeway onramp at three times the speed limit. Within the context of the vehicle it’s not exactly the end of the world, but the past few cars I’ve driven have been C8’s, McLarens, and Porsches, so the handling difference was noticeable to me. 

One thing I noticed, and it’s possible this is all placebo, is the Z4’s traction control system does a lot to force the “understeery” behavior. With it fully engaged I found it wanting me to brake earlier to scrub speed, and in general I had a harder time getting the front end to feel “natural” to me. If you press the traction control button once you enter “Dynamic Traction Control” and with this enabled the front end starts to behave a lot more predictably, you can brake later, and in general the car starts to feel more “natural” to drive. 

My C8 and C7 Corvettes have had performance traction modes but they really translated into how much slip the car allowed when using the throttle. These modes didn’t dramatically change the handling characteristics of the vehicle like the “Dynamic Traction Control” mode does on the Z4. So I am genuinely curious if using this mode was just placebo on my end or if being in that modes makes a dramatic difference in vehicle behavior. 

**Approachable brakes** 

The brakes on the Z4 are great. Easy to use in traffic, plenty of stopping power and ability to scrub speed, easy modulation no matter how hard you are driving it. I will say the brakes don’t exactly exude the “we’ll bail you out of any situation” characteristic like I’ve found on other vehicles, but they’re well mated to the car and you have a lot of confidence when using them. 

**Comfortable suspension**

The suspension on the Z4 is incredibly comfortable. Even in sports plus mode the Z4 has a tendency to absorb bumps very well and you can drive this car on some very rough roads without feeling like you are being jostled around or losing confidence due to mid corner bumps, etc. 

I would say the damping feels much more sophisticated than that of a Cayman or 911, but it’s a noticeable notch below the comfort of a Taycan, Artura, or C8 which are the vehicles I’d classify as “best in class”

While you do have a lot of confidence and general comfort in the M40i it is a vehicle with a shorter wheelbase so you do feel the front and rear being effected by bumps in pretty quick succession. This can make things feel a bit more “busy” than they would in a vehicle with a longer wheelbase, but again things generally don’t feel sharp or harsh in the M40i by any means. 


**Practicality:** 
 **Solid tech**
The Z4 comes with a pretty solid selection of tech features (good back up camera, adaptive cruise control, parking sensors, blind spot detection, ambient lighting, easy android auto integration, but also a solid onboard nav system). It feels “of this generation” unlike the infotainment systems of Porsche and Mercedes which somehow always feel a gen or two behind. Likewise, it seems like all of the tech “just works” which I’d contrast against some other cars like Porsche or McLaren where things are just finicky for no reason. 

My only call-out is the infotainment system wasn’t super intuitive to me (lots of menus and submenus with no easy way to dive in and out quickly) but I feel like this comes with the territory on any German car and after a full week or two I’d probably be used to it. 

**Ample cabin space+storage**

The cabin feels sufficiently roomy and feels like the front of basically any normal car. Which is to say, you just don’t have to think about where things go in this vehicle because everything tends to have a natural space. I’d contrast this against a Cayman, which feels very “efficient” in its space usage, but because everything is so tight and crammed together you’re always thinking about where to place things in the cabin. 

Trunk space is fairly large and isn’t compromised by using the convertible top. You can easily transport plenty of luggage for a weekend trip, get groceries in this car, etc. 

**Needs ventilated seats**

While I was impressed with the general level of amenities offered in the Z4, I do think a car like this needs ventilated seats. It makes a huge difference for sunny days with the top down, and not having the ventilated seats led to some sweaty shirts when driving. 

**Lacking sound system?**

One genuine complaint about the Z4 is I had a hard time getting the sound system to sound good. I couldn’t tell whether my vehicle had the base sound system or the Harmon Kardon sound system. I am going to assume it was the base system since I couldn’t see any Harmon Kardon branding. 

The sound system just sounded very flat the whole time, for some reason it was lacking in volume so I had to keep it at close to 75% volume just to have my music at an audible level, in general it did not allow me to drive and jam to my tunes in the same way that most other vehicles allow.

**Solid build quality, cheaper materials**

My rental was a 2020 model with about 50,000 miles on it. To the car’s credit it felt very solidly built. There were no creaks or rattles and all of the buttons and touch points seemed completely fine in terms of wear. 

My car did have the “base” interior with sensodyne leather. I will say the interior felt a bit cheaper to me than I thought it should. Even a base C8 feels like it has higher quality materials to interact with, but considering the fact that the Z4 was still rattle free I’ll take it! 

**Great open air experience**

The Z4 provides a really enjoyable open air experience. The top takes about 10 seconds to put up or down and isn’t finicky to use at all. When the top is down there is very little wind buffeting  and you can easily drive at highway speeds in comfort. The open air experience is so seamless, easy, and comfortable I basically only drove the Z4 with the top down. That being said, with the top up the Z4 was surprisingly well insulated. There was no major wind noise coming through, and road/tire noise was kept to a minimal as well. It isn’t a “vault-like” experience like my Taycan is, but I’d say it’s noticeably quieter than a C8. 

**Easy to drive**

The Z4 is a genuinely easy car to drive. In “comfort” or “eco pro” mode the Z4 feels like a completely normal car. A lot of sports cars can feel “normal” when not in sport or sports plus mode, and I’d say the Z4 is another notch or two in “normalcy” beyond what other sports cars offer. 
 The Z4’s turning radius is great, ride height generally isn’t an issue or worry, and I had no problem placing the Z4 in traffic. It’s one of those vehicles where you can literally hop into it at any time, rain or shine, regardless of task, and not have a worry about it. 

**Overall Driving Experience:**

I think the biggest thing that stands out is the Z4 M40i generally feels more normal car than sports car. Cold starts are relatively smooth and quiet, initial steering inputs give no indication that the car has some strong handling pedigree lying beneath (because there isn’t one), and initial throttle inputs feel very smooth and almost economical. 

You also very much realize that despite the Z4’s relatively small dimensions, it’s not a car that’s going to shrink around you. The Supra is a car that feels smaller in the flesh than its dimensions indicate, the Z4 somehow feels larger in the flesh than its dimensions indicate. In driving the Z4 you get the impression that the car is is going to do its own thing and you just happen to be in it, there’s not a seamless driver-vehicle oneness connection implied here.  

Where the Z4 starts to get fun is in this uncanny valley of normalcy and aggression that it creates once you are in sports plus mode. In sports plus mode upshifts and downshifts start to kick you, and they’re damn fun to experience. You press the throttle for a little bit and you’re pinned to your seat thanks to the torque and get the impression that it will keep building and building as long as you hold down the pedal. You take a turn a little fast, and it isn’t as sharp or as locked in as you maybe want, but the chassis sticks without issue and you realize the amount of steering input you had to do to make that happen was kind of exciting and kind of engaging. 

You genuinely get to experience a lot of the elements that make a sports car fun, aggressive shifts, constant torque, a chassis that’s capable but needs to be pushed a little bit, all in a package that can go back to complete “normal” whenever you want it to. 

I also like that the Z4 isn’t exactly a  “slow car fast” experience either. You get plenty of involvement with the Z4 at speed legal speeds, but you can carry some speed well into the triple digits before really needing to feel like you need to back down. I’d say this is a really nice sweet spot, where you don’t feel like you’re running out of “oomph” at street speeds by any means, but the car is alive enough at street speeds for you to really enjoy it. 

While the Z4 M40i is a potent and somewhat understated vehicle, I did find that it attracted some odd attention. BMW bros and other mid-level Audi, JDM, and Mercedes drivers all wanted to race or do stupid stuff with me. Likewise the Z4 M40i isn’t an apex predator by any means so it felt like Corvettes and Porsches took a special delight in pulling up next to me and just blasting away for a good chuckle. While the Z4 feels incredibly fast and potent in its own world, once you’re up against something more purpose built the Z4’s performance limitations become more apparent. 

I’ve driven a healthy amount of high-end cars, I don’t think the Z4 is going to really scratch that “dream car” itch quite the same way a sports car or super car would. However what stood out to me on the canyons is the Z4 is about 85%-90% of the experience as a lot of those high-end cars. The way it builds speed is just downright enjoyable, it upshifts and downshifts more aggressively than a Cayman or Carrera S, while the handling isn’t as sharp as it probably needs to be, you’re still having plenty of fun taking turns, feeling the suspension work around you, and making adjustments with your inputs. The beauty is you get to experience all of this in a car that’s completely normal when you want it to be, and frankly needs a lot less care and attention than a proper sports car. 

It’s kind of like being with a six who is really good in bed. Your brain tells you it doesn’t exactly like the idea, but when all is said and done you also can’t deny how good it actually was. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR:**

In some ways driving the Z4 M40i was a lot funner than I thought it would be, but in other ways there are some ingredients missing that I wish it had. 

On the fun side the Z4 does a great job of delivering power and just feeling fast whenever you want it to. You can use a lot of throttle without going to jail and you still get an experience that is very close to that of high-end turbocharged cars. Likewise the car does properly come to life on the canyons and you can experience a very engaging and rewarding driving experience on curvy roads.  

I am a big fan of how seamlessly the Z4 behaves as a “normal car”. I think Corvettes and Porsches are “very low compromise” sports cars, the Z4 feels like there’s no compromise in how it behaves in day to day driving. This makes it a car that is genuinely easy to hop in at any time and in any condition. 

That being said, the Z4 does lack a little bit of that sports car edge. The cold start is very underwhelming, and immediately reminds you of just how “normal” the Z4 is. Likewise while the handling does work on the canyons, you don’t quite get that “this is a weapon” feeling like you do with other sports cars. Honestly if the car was about 20% sharper in the handling department it would go a long way. While I do praise the Z4 for how versatile and normal it is, it also lacks a little bit of that “aura” that other sports cars typically have. You can’t have your cake and eat it too, but not having that “special car” feeling isn’t something I thought I’d miss until it wasn’t there. 

That being said, I actually found the Z4 to be a far more rewarding driving experience than the Cayman S I recently reviewed. The powertrain makes the Z4 feel much more fun than the Cayman, while the Cayman presents itself as a more potent handler at face value, I actually found the Z4 to provide a better sense of speed and engagement when canyon carving. 

I am seeing the Z4 M40i for around $40-$50K used and I think this car offers a lot of bang for your buck at that price point. In fact I’d say it’s probably the best all purpose sports car you can buy at that money. New these are around $76K. At that price point I think a C8 is the better overall buy, but I also think spending $76K on this is a better buy than a $95K base Boxster or Boxster S. 

All in all I think the Z4 M40i is pretty sweet. I’ve actually short listed this car because the value proposition is there and it neatly checks all of the boxes for my “road trip” needs. If you’re emotionally gunning for a purpose built sports car the Z4 won’t do it for you, but if you want something that’s just damn easy to live with and gives you the highlights of a lot of great vehicles there’s a lot to enjoy here.",Toyota,87,0.87,2025-09-08 02:49:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1nb2xb3/my_extensive_2020_bmw_z4_m40i_review/

Interestingly, the official time for the old 992.1 Turbo S was never revealed until now. The new car has more power but is also gained significant weight. Top speed for the new car is actually down 5 mph, likely due to lower output from the gas engine, which contributes the majority of the thrust at high speeds.

cars,I don't really get all the hate for the Prelude,"Hi,

I'm curious about talking about it I apologize in advance for the grammar.

I see a lot of comments about the Prelude only being a Civic hybrid in disguise but.. is'nt that the point ? It's a 2-door Civic ?

I'm pretty sure when Honda stopped the 2-doors Civic this sub was all bent on losing  it and ''The dying of the small 2-doors coupe'' segment (Golf, Altima, Tiburon (?), Cobalt..). Now Honda is bringing back the Civic coupe, calling it a Prelude and we're not okay with that ?? Next to the Prelude, is'nt a pedestrian 4-doors Civic kind of an SUV ?

I would think that knowing it will be a lower volume model Honda has made their bets that older people with more income (see : willing to pay for the hybrid tax, want more features) would be a bigger part of the clientele that the 18-25 age range, so they're making lesser variants, saving costs.

  
I'm ~~28~~ 29. The next car my wife were thinking about would have been the hybrid Civic. We're both telling ourselves that we're never gonna go the SUV route and I honestly think the Prelude will be a nice way to go even more against the usual. *(Lightly used in 2-3 years we're not made of money)*.

cars,The Prelude is closer to an Insight than Civic,"The upcoming Honda Prelude is shaping up to be more spiritually aligned with the Insight than the Civic, despite its sporty coupe silhouette. At its core, the Prelude is built around Honda’s refined two-motor hybrid system, which has long been the heart of the Insight’s quiet, efficient driving experience. While the Civic has recently adopted hybrid variants, its still more utilitarian and practical in performance and styling. In contrast, the Prelude, like the Insight, leans into a more mature, luxurious aesthetic prioritizing smoothness,comfort, and technology.

whatcarshouldIbuy,I’m sick and tired of hearing people defending Toyota,"I get it. They have the most reliable and practical powertrain out there. Their hybrid system has almost no competition (you can make a case for Honda tho). I test drove a few new Corollas and Camries before and must admit everything’s just so seamlessly engineered. Responsive, quiet, snappy, and fuel efficient. 
But the price tag sickens everyone to the bone. Most manufacturers would sell their cars at discounted prices. Toyota dealerships always sell theirs ABOVE MSRP during and after COVID. Their interior is HORRENDOUSLY cheap, thin, and plasticky. (It’s funny how the brand new Corolla SE even squeaked and creaked a little bit from the headliner and A pillar on bumpy roads when I was test driving it. Crazy!) Most competitors (VW Jetta, Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra) would offer a firmer, sturdier interior build packed with more technology.

I wouldn’t call that a trade-off (the idea that you’re trading interior material quality for better overall reliability). I call that cost cutting and corporate greed.",Toyota,1263,0.76,2025-09-19 19:06:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1nl1qns/im_sick_and_tired_of_hearing_people_defending/

whatcarshouldIbuy,"Lexus ES 300h - Review at 8,200 km (5,095 miles)","Ladies and gentleman, please fasten your seatbelts and maybe go grab some snacks before reading this review. This is an extensive review from personal perspective, so it is going to be a long read that maybe one or two of you will reach the end.

Still, I’ve decided to share my personal experience with Lexus ES 300h, in hopes of helping others who are thinking about buying this car. You can DM me if you want to know other things which are not in this review or about other cars that I’ve previously owned.

**TLDR** is available at the end of the review.



**Disclaimer and Context**

My English isn’t the best, so patience please.

I’m providing an extensive context and I will be mentioning these cars, so that the other people that have similar cars to me, can know how to feel about the review. For example, if you feel like Santa Fe has soft suspension like I do, then you will feel that the ES 300h has hard suspension like I do.

When I say mid-sized sedan, I’m referring to cars bigger than Yaris and smaller than S Class.

This review is from a personal perspective of a normal daily driver

* This is not a technical review
* I’m not a mechanic
* I’m not a car guy.

I live in a South American country

* Weather is nice and dry (usually)
* Terrible road conditions
* Trim levels might have different names in the US
* Prices are very different from the US
* Prices are approximate as I don’t remember the price exactly
* Prices are in USD, exchange rate at September 19th

Context of the driver

* Single (if anyone is interested) mid 20s, 186 cm (6’1 foot) and 90 kg (200 pounds)
* Daily commute of 29 km (18 miles), 2 to 3 hours in total during medium to high traffic
* Weekend commute of 600 km (372 miles), whole day on the road with Santa Fe and Rarely Lexus
* Calm driving habits on daily commute obeying the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph), flooring the gas on weekends on highways
* Actually reads the car manual and follows the maintenance schedule like a bible



**Previously owned cars:**

2009 Hyundai Elantra w/ 1.6 NA (used)

Longest drive: 280 km (174 miles)

Use: 1 year w/ 10,000 km (6,214 miles)

My first car that I got for “free” after getting scammed and the car was the only thing that they left before fleeing to another country. The car had around 140,000 km (86,992 miles) and was in bad condition, spent around 2,000 USD to fix it and sold it for 4,000 USD. I really liked the car, it was reliable after fixing it, didn’t have any distracting tech and had a side brake stick instead of a button.



2022 Hyundai Santa Fe Value w/ 2.5 NA (new)

Longest drive: 2800 km (1740 miles) in 4 days

Use: 1 year w/ 26,000 km (16,156 miles)

My second car that I bought during the pandemic for 25,000 USD all in cash. I gave it to my dad when their 2021 Ford Explorer (also got it for “”free”) broke down. It was a great car for the price, it didn’t have any problems, hated button gear shift, loved the 3rd row seats and spacious cargo space. I still use this car a lot on weekends due to the cargo space. Contrary to popular belief, Hyundai’s are reliable enough if taken care of (currently at 78,000 km (48,467 miles), long drives, rough terrains).



2023 Honda CR-V Touring w/ 1.5 Turbo (new)

Longest drive: 500 km (311 miles)

Use: 1 year w/ 18,000 km (11,185 miles)

My third car that I bought for 42,000 USD all in cash. CR-V Touring was the only available trim when I bought it and hybrids weren’t available. I gave it to my mom when she needed a car after moving further from work. I didn't like the car, it didn’t have any major issues but the car felt slower than the Elantra and had many minor problems.



**The Actual Review**

2024 Lexus ES 300h Luxury w/ 2.5 NA Hybrid (new)

Longest drive: 600 km (373 miles)

Use: 8 months and going w/ 8,000 km (5,095 miles) on the odometer

My fourth car that I bought for 58,000 USD all in cash. ES 300h Luxury was the only trim available in my country as Lexus sedans don't really sell much here. According to the dealership they only sell around one monthly and haven’t seen another ES here. I did see two GS 350 before but mostly it's the NX or RX that are on the road. I bought the car after giving my CR-V to my mom.

ES stands for Executive Sedan, so it’s a mid-sized sedan that competes against Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Mercedes A Class (at least in my region). I bought the car because I wanted a mid-sized sedan with absolute reliability as the country I live in has terrible after service, scarce parts and long wait for repairs. Also, I didn’t want a car that didn't draw much attention like other German luxury cars.



**Design**

I’m not going to elaborate much on the exterior and interior design of the car, as whether the car looks good or bad is subjective. Also, you can go to see the car in person or on a website.

Nothing much to say about exterior design, except that it looks very nice. Personally, ES has the best styling among the competition, it has a sleek aerodynamic and sporty look but not exaggerated with a touch of maturity, it looks modern but classic at the same time. Front LED lights are bright enough and the rear fog lights are useful for bad weather conditions. It has an 18 in wheel with steel look. Build quality is excellent, no panel gaps, paint finish is perfect and the car has been durable on the outside.

Again, nothing much to say about the interior as it looks boring yet refined. Everything I see is covered in leather with stitching well done. I like that some parts like the glove box above are  covered in black wood (not real wood, just the looks), everything just feels very well done. Also, I personally love the analog clock next to the infotainment screen.



**Seat**

My height is 186 cm (6’1 foot), front and rear leg room are plenty with room to spare. You could fit 3 people in the back seat if squeezed but it is more suited for 2 people on longer drives. The driver seat has 3 memory seats with an adjustable electric power seat, along with the typical seat adjustments you can also change seat height, leg extension (never used it personally, tall enough to be useless for me) and lumber support. The steering wheel is adjustable electronically, it also adjusts its position automatically whenever I enter and exit so I don’t hit my leg on the steering wheel. I have the seat adjusted to the lowest and can only fit two fingers between my head and the ceiling. I do get a bit more headroom on the back seats, but if you are taller than me, I wouldn’t recommend getting the car unless you are a masochist. Front seats are heated and ventilated with a heated steering wheel.



**Visibility**

The car has good visibility and the windows are big enough. The side mirror has curves in the end for blind spots. The rear view mirror is also big enough. If the side mirrors are well adjusted you won’t have any problems with visibility. And the rear window has a sunshade which you can put it up and down with a button, it automatically goes down when putting the car in reverse.



**Cabin noise**

It is very quiet on ideal road conditions but when the road gets rough you can hear quite a bit of road noise. The car is very quiet on highways below 140 km/h (87 mph), but after exceeding the speed, the wind noise gets considerably noisy. Engine sound is nonexistent on highways when idling below 2000 rpm. On the streets the engine noise is quieter compared to CR-V or Santa Fe.



**Technology**

The 12 Inch Infotainment system is slightly tilted towards the driver’s seat, it is plenty big enough for navigation and it feels responsive to touch. Software wise there is a lot of customization that you can do like audio, automatic climatization, sound, etc. I use a Samsung so I can’t comment on Apple Carplay, Android Auto is connected by usb cable, it works fine most of the time but I had to change the cable once because it kept disconnecting even though the cable, even though the cable worked fine when charging with charging brick. It has a HUD that indicates speed and rpm (it can be customized a bit). It has 17 Mark Levinson speakers, which sounds really nice especially for classical music. My CR-V had Bose speakers which had heavy bass which I didn’t like for sounding so mushy. Like many modern cars, you there are many features like surround sound, sound position, etc.



**Controls**

It has buttons and knobs, they are very nice. It feels good to the touch, it doesn’t have any wiggles or imperfections. You can control all the car with these buttons except for temperature sync and rear ventilation on and off, which can only be activated on the infotainment system. There is a physical gear stick instead of buttons. The parking brake is electronic instead of a lever, which puts the brake on automatically when you put it in park.



**Driver Assistance**

Adaptive cruise control is so nice to have on long drives, it accelerates and decelerates accordingly, it slows down on the curves and stops well on emergencies. The 360° camera turns on when the gear is in reverse or you can turn it on manually when going under 20 km/h (12 mph), it is useful to have on some occasions but I don’t really use it as I am used to old 2009 Elantra with no rear view camera or sensors. Automatic braking which has saved me once from crashing on a highway, it also has automatic braking when in reverse but it has been more of a hassle than useful as it automatically brakes when a car passes by, a single leaf from a tree falls or close to a wall that I need to get close to park. A collision warning when reversing which I don’t like because I have to back out from my house and it thinks I’m going to crash into the traffic on the other side. It also has many sensors, maybe too much for my liking as I live in an area with tight spaces and the sensors go crazy even though I’m not going to crash. A lane assist which is terrible for me as the road marking in my country is worse than nothing. Often the handle will try to adjust to the road markings almost crashing into other vehicles. Currently have this turned off.



**Connectivity**

* Android auto by cable
* Bluetooth audio
* One usb A port for android auto and many usb c port on the front and back seat for charging only
* 12 volt socket for dash cam that I bought



**Driving**

It has a 2.5 liter naturally aspirated engine with a hybrid system which makes 215 horsepower on paper. The transmission is a CVT. Performance wise, the car feels very responsive. The car accelerates when I want to and stops when I want to, it is really easy to merge on the highways. It is worth mentioning that the car has a rev limiter at 6000 rpm and doesn’t go over 190 km/h (118 mph). The car definitely isn’t the fastest car, I would even say that the car is slow and boring, despite its relatively sporty look. It definitely isn’t a fun car to drive, but if you are buying a Lexus ES, you don’t buy for fun but reliability and comfort.

It has eco, normal and sports mode. What it basically does is that in eco mode the car tries to run on battery and keeps the engine under 2000 revolution (it does reach 6000 rpm when flooring it), normal mode is just normal and sports mode where the car keeps the engine on idle longer than the normal mode and it does feel faster (maybe? Or just placebo). Santa Fe (DCT) also had a sports mode where I could feel the car changing gears at higher rpm, but I don’t feel that in ES (CVT).

The car handles very well, it goes where I want to and turns nicely. It does feel like I’m driving a boat as the car is quite long, but still handles very well. I once had a close call on the streets because a car switched lane rapidly into my lane without signaling and I turned the handle quickly to avoid it and it handled it really well without causing an accident.

Suspension is on the rough side compared to Elantra, Santa Fe and CR-V. When hitting a pothole it feels like the car is going to fall apart. Obviously the car isn’t for rough roads due to the car being very low, as I have scraped the car’s undercarriage a lot on potholes, speed bumps and uneven surfaces. But on highways with decent surfaces, the car drives like a smooth butter.

Due to what I do, I have to go off the road from time to time, and let’s just say stay on the road. You can go on dirt roads but when it is raining or there is an inclination, just don’t, the car will get stuck. Beach sand is also a no go. Grass is also a no go. Just don’t, stay on the road. Also, I almost crashed once on light snow (my country rarely gets any snow, maybe once a year). Again, just stay on the road.

Finally, braking. The car is heavy on the heavier side for a sedan at kerb weight of 1742 kg (4840 pounds), with passenger and cargo the car can get quite heavy. It generally brakes well (obviously it doesn’t brake well when raining), but it just won’t break on dry or wet dirt roads if you are going over 30 km/h (19 mph). Again, stay on the road with this car. Also, it has a regenerative braking system, when not accelerating the electric motor will brake the car a tiny bit. It feels kind of weird when braking at low speeds on streets as the car changes from regenerative braking to disk braking where the car jerks minimally.



**Fuel economy**

Fuel economy on daily commute and highways is around 14 \~ 16 km/l (33 \~ 38 mpg) and 18 km/l (42 mpg) respectively, which is lower than advertised even though I follow the hybrid driving instructions on the manual. If I really try hard to get fuel efficient, I can get about 20 km/l (47 mpg) but then I would get too stressed if I have to drive the car like that everyday.

Fuel economy for reference on my older cars:

Elantra 10 km/l (24 mpg)

Santa Fe 8 km/l (19 mpg)

CR-V 12 km/l (28 mpg)



**Maintenance**

The maintenance period on my car is for every 10000 km (6214 miles) or one year, my first maintenance will cost around 441 USD at the only Lexus dealership in my country. I did oil change on the first 1000 km (621 miles) and a free maintenance that the dealership offers after the first month. Lexus was the only dealership to provide me with a LBX for replacement during the first month of maintenance which took a few hours.



**Practicality**

There is plenty of cargo space on Lexus if you are using it for daily commute and normal activities. The trunk is spacious and you can put the rear seat down for more space. It fits luggages, golf bags and groceries with space to spare. The car can fit 5 people with the driver, 4 people if you are doing a long road trip. I don’t have kids but I know that it has ISOFIX and you can turn off the passenger side airbag. It is nice to have door locks on the rear seats because I have a younger brother.

Due to the nature of my work, sometimes I have to carry wood, concrete and other heavy equipment. If you open the sunroof of the car and put the rear seat down, you can somehow fit some 3.2 meter (10.5 foot / 126 inch) wood, but you will scratch the sunroof and leather if you don’t put cloth underneath it. You can also put some stucco (plaster? I’m not sure what it is called in the US) on the trunk. I once fit 20 bags of stucco which weighed 500 kg (1100 pounds) in total, yeah don’t. It did fit, but the car was almost touching the ground and scraped on all the speedbumps on the way.

As the car is low it is quite hard to get on and off the car. The 360° camera helps when parallel parking as the car is quite long but when parking in reverse you can just look in the mirrors. ES is the hardest car to park compared to Elantra, Santa Fe and CR-V. It is also nice that the side mirrors tilt downwards when reversing allowing me to see the parking lines.

Never towed anything.



**Safety**

Don’t know, I never got into an accident in my life thanks to defensive driving. The automatic braking system and good handling have saved me from potential accidents. Safety features are on the driver assistance section mentioned before.

Also, the car might have bullet proof reliability, but it isn’t bullet proof.

According to Euro NCAP, it has a 5 star safety rating.

**Why I Chose Lexus ES 300h**

As I have said before, when I was looking for a car, I wanted a mid-sized sedan. So, I was left with these 3 models. Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Mercedes A Class (again, price varies a lot compared to US so you might not consider these to be on the same level)

I really wanted a Toyota Camry, but they didn’t import Camry to my region (My region doesn’t import: Camry, Sonata, Accord, Acura, Legacy, K5, Cadillac, Dodge, Chrysler, Genesis and more).

* Audi A4 was basically a Volkswagen Jetta with a different badge, the car felt very cheap and incomplete with tons of poverty buttons.

* BMW 3 Series, the dealership treated me very poorly. The car had 4 series badging instead of 3 series (a mistake from the assembly) and the interior looked too modern with a button gear shift.

* Mercedes A Class, absolutely loved the interior except for the buttons on the steering wheel. Also I didn’t like the small 1.3 engine.

While contemplating which car to choose I saw an advertisement for the Lexus ES 300h on YouTube. A reliable mid-sized sedan, 2.5 NA hybrid engine, 215 horsepower and an elegant design. So I went to the dealership, liked the car and bought the car.



**Little things I love:**

Mark Levinson speakers

Power windows

The cops don’t pull you over as much as in Santa Fe (at least in my country)



**Little things I don’t like:**

Leather making squeaking noise sometimes (I guess it is going to wear down and make less noise in the future)

Too many sensors and automatic braking systems when reversing those brakes with a single tree leaf.



**Buy Lexus ES 300h if you:**

* Want the proven reliability of Lexus
* Drive a lot on a highway for long hours
* Want better fuel economy compared to Santa Fe
* Want great handling and acceleration

**Don’t Buy Lexus ES 300h if you:**

* Live in an area with rough road
* Work in construction (kind of obvious)
* Need to go to off the road onto dirt or sand



**Finishing the Review**

Finishing the review, I guess you can summarize the car as “boring car”, but not in a bad way. It’s a Lexus, so you know that it is going to be stupid reliable, it has great acceleration (for normal use) and handling, Mark Levinson speakers sound amazing and the car looks refined.

However, I’m currently thinking of switching the car with my old Santa Fe which my dad currently uses. Why? Because I was stupid enough to think that a FWD sedan could replace an AWD SUV while working a non office job.

No mistake, I love the car but it just doesn’t fit my needs. Also, the car just feels too luxurious for me. What I looked for when buying the Lexus was the absolute reliability and practicality, maybe I should have bought the Toyota 4Runner or Fortuner for more practicality.

Personal advices before buying a car:

* Test drive the car
* Get a rental car for at least a week
* Don't finance the car
* Read the manual
* Check the maintenance price



Again, this is a review is from a **PERSONAL** viewpoint. Please at least test drive the car before buying it.



**TLDR**

Buy Lexus ES 300h for its reliability, comfort and audio system. Great for daily commute and long drives. The car obviously has its limits like passenger, cargo, off-road, etc. Again, test drive the car.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Help me choose an EV! And I value the interior more than the exterior,"Hi all, my list is very particular so hopefully a good challenge for all. No budget limitation.

My base ideal is a polestar/Volvo. Pano sunroof with polychromatic, headrest speakers (I tested this and being an audio geek completely fell in love), heated, ventilated, and massaging seats. Comfort at the back with tilted seats. Range should be at least 350 miles but the higher the better.

Don't care about acceleration, don't care about looks, don't care about ""performance"". I want the car to be comfortable for a family in long trips.

What turned me off from the Polestar and Volvo EX90/ES90 was the infotainment. I love tech but not having physical buttons felt cheap and unreliable. And the layout to open the four windows with two buttons is atrocious.

I looked into the equivalent Audi (S6 etron) but the sound system pales in comparison. The BMW i7 looks very old fashioned inside. The Porsche Taycan has an awful range of 250ish.

The Lotus Eletra seems to tick all my boxes but I haven't test driven it yet, and the price seems a bit excessive because of the performance (which I don't value) because I can't get the luxurious interior trim with the low performance one. But I'll have a look.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Used Car or New Car? Which one should I buy?,"I’m a 26-year-old male currently searching for a vehicle. I’ve been actively looking for a car for a couple of weeks, but the prices of used cars here in Canada are incredibly high. My budget is CAD $10,000, but within that range, I’m unable to find any vehicles. If I increase my budget to CAD $15,000, most of the vehicles I come across are either Hyundai SantaFe, Kia Soranto, or Ford Edge, all with mileage between 150k and 200k and years of ownership between 2010 and 2015.

I need a car for my work, where I’ll be meeting clients regularly and also for travel around or long trips to mountains (500 - 1000km). I don’t want to spend money on a vehicle that breaks down immediately or requires frequent repairs.

Considering my situation, should I opt for a used car or a new car? New Toyota Rav4 or Honda CRV are between CAD 40k and 50k, which would require a down payment of 5k to 10k. The main concerns I have are the monthly payments and the depreciation of the vehicle. I’m planning to buy a house in a year and will need a mortgage. Having a car loan would reduce my mortgage amount.

On the other hand, I don’t want to spend $10k on a car and have to sit in a garage for a week. I also don’t have the time or the money to spend on a used vehicle.

I’m currently debating between a Honda Civic Hybrid Sport (about CAD 45k) and a Subaru Impreza RS (CAD 39k). Looking at likely new given the small difference in price between an almost new version of each car. 

I’ve test driven a few cars and it came down to the Mazda CX 30, Honda HRV, Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic Hybrid. Ultimately I really preferred the sporty feel of a smaller vehicle and ended up cutting the CX 30 and HRV off my list. 

What I need the vehicle for is basic commuting, longer highway commutes, driving in the snow on back country roads for weekend getaways or winter activities. The yearly km’s I’ll put on it is about 10k (~6200 miles). Although I need it for practical reasons I really wanted a fun driving experience especially for those days I have a longer commute. 

I enjoyed driving both and thought the Honda safety features seemed more “on the ball” based on my test drives vs the Subaru. The Subaru is a bit more comfortable in space overall but the acceleration is a bit slower compared to a hybrid. I’d really appreciate different opinions on the options above especially for those of you who have driven some of these and have some experience. 

Lastly, I’ve really found all the dealerships not able to budge on price. I haven’t bought a car in a long time so just wondering is that typical now and what your experiences have been buying a car in general.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Need advice: 2021 Audi A5 Sportback vs 2022 BMW 228i xDrive,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently cross-shopping two certified pre-owned cars and would love some outside perspective. I plan to keep whichever I buy for at least **3 years**, and I don’t plan on swapping cars anytime soon. I’m fine with higher mileage as long as the car runs well, but I admit the “near-new” factor is also appealing.

Here are the details:

* **2021 Audi A5 Sportback Premium 40 TFSI**
   * Price: **$27k**
   * Mileage: **50k+**
   * 1-owner lease vehicle, **Audi Certified Pre-Owned** with 1 yr/20k warranty
   * No accidents, clean history
   * Recent major services: spark plugs, transmission fluid, brake fluid, alignment, 2 new tires, front brake pads & rotors. Basically had the big 40k service already done.
* **2022 BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe**
   * Price: **$27k**
   * Mileage: **14k**
   * 1-owner personal vehicle, **BMW CPO**, with about 12 months/35k of factory warranty remaining
   * No accidents, clean history
   * Only routine oil changes so far (but that makes sense given the low mileage).

**What I care about:**

* Reliability and peace of mind for the next 3-5 years
* Total cost of ownership (maintenance, repairs, depreciation)
* How people perceive these cars (I’m in academia)
* I don’t mind paying for proper maintenance, but I don’t want a money pit.

**My read so far:**

* The **Audi A5** is the more stylish, premium feeling car, and it already had most of the big 50k mile service done. Downside: higher mileage and the factory warranty is gone (just the CPO coverage left).
* The **BMW 228i** is basically a “near-new” car with very low miles and warranty coverage. Downside: it’s more of an entry-level BMW, so it doesn’t have the same presence as the A5, and I’d probably face more depreciation.

I’m torn – the Audi seems like the “classier” pick, but the BMW seems like the safer bet for the next 5 years.

**So if you were in my shoes, which one would you choose? And why?**

Thanks in advance!

whatcarshouldIbuy,Advice on buying a lowrider,I don’t know anything about cars but when I was younger loved the look of “old” muscle cars. Now that I actually have a car I don’t care to go fast just want a cool ride. I’m also a huge fan of Eddie Guerrero who had a low rider. I’ve seen a lot of them on Facebook marketplace but they aren’t in the best condition and seem to need a lot of work. How much would it cost to buy once in good condition and what should I look out for when buying one? Once again I don’t know anything about cars. My boyfriend knows a little bit more than me and might be able to help out with simple fixes.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Manual Getta GLI Autobahn vs Genesis G80 5.0,"Hello! 

I'm on the fence between 2 cars.

1. Used Jetta Gli Autobahn Manual - around $27k, 30k miles or less
2. Used Genesis G80 V8 5.0 - around $28k, 50k miles or less

I originally wanted manual transmission daily driver that have enough space for 2 kids in a back and is sporty. Done research and Jetta gli was the pick.  I haven't driven one yet, but wil go test drive one at carmax next week.

I was sure im done choosing. However, while browsing carmax I stumbled upon 2018-19 Genesis g80. I've seen the car before and loved the looks and interior. I also always wanted V8 - never had one. And i saw has relatively affordable it is. It was basically same Jetta money but more miles. However, I heard they are reliable and 50k miles is nothing.

And it got me thinking. Yeah, I wanted a manual. But damn this 5.0.genesis looks amazing.

And now I dont know what to do lol.

I can't afford both of these cars, but want a manual and something like g80 - comfortable, powerful, cruiser.

I even started to think that i can get a cheap manual car later for fun - like Mini cooper (fan of those cars), fiat 500 abarth,  miata etc. In addition to Genesis ?

Or better follow old dream owning a manual expensive car as 1 car only, though I am driving in the city and there are no place for spiritual driving lol.

Sorry for long text, and i know noone will make a decision for me.

Just wanted to ask- given this choice - what would you pick?

whatcarshouldIbuy,Lexus NX or Mazda CX-5 2nd generation?,"Yo! 

Im in the market for a new vehicle with a budget of $20k and I’ve narrowed my choices down to these two vehicles. Both are good on gas and have a nice clean look. Very appealing. 

Normally, I would say the Lexus without question, but I’ve read how good the Mazda CX-5 has been for consumers and the praise for their engines and interior quality. Lexus probably is still better overall, but I’m sure the gap has closed considerably, especially with Mazda offering more bang for your buck. 

When I look for a vehicle, I typically lean towards the timelessness of the maker and mode along with the reliability. Lexus will always have a name that resonates with people. They never seemingly become old. Mazda doesn’t have the name recognition like Lexus, but the CX-5’s look is classic and they have grown in reliability.

I know I dont want a sedan any longer (former 2016 nissan sentra SV owner, it did the job) 

I think compact SUV's would be nice for me (31F) not to big or small and I would like to sit a bit higher as im getting older! Im in Florida, I use the highway the most for daily work commute( about 35 miles roundtrip). I enjoy driving, I go to orlando and Sarasota on a monthly basis. Also, I like driving all the way down to key west  and up to Atlanta/Savanna about 1-3x in a year. I definitely have plans on doing more out of state roadtrips once i get this car.

Im searching for a car with good warranty and wont drain my $ to much in order to maintain if any issues. A car that can take the miles I'll be putting on it. Im somewhat of a speeder, not always intentional, but I would like a car that wont feel like its dragging on the highway (if that makes sense).

Some options Ive looked into are:

\-Mazda cx30 (plan on test driving soon)

\-Hyundai Venue (im obsessed with this boxy/square look, though i did test drive the Limited trim and it was nice, but very basic inside for a 2025 car, less horsepower than my former nissan so im not sure) 

\-Honda CR-V (plan on test driving soon)

\-Subaru Crosstrek (plan on test driving soon)

whatcarshouldIbuy,Should I buy a new EV before tax credit goes away?,"I’m wondering if the math checks out or if I’m looking at this from the wrong point of view.

Currently drive a 2022 Tesla M3 AWD / Long Range with 160k miles. Payment is $800/mo and I still owe $14k over the next 16 months. I plugged my details into Auto Nation and they say I can get $11k for it.

I drive a lot for work, clearly, and get reimbursed for using my personal vehicle. Around 40k miles/year. The monthly reimbursement is a $700 fixed payment plus 0.27c variable payment per mile which turns out to be around $1700/mo fixed+variable to cover all car related expenses.

I have been telling myself I’ll buy a new car when this one approaches the 200k+ mile zone which will likely be later in 2026 or early 2027. By then it will be finally be paid off or close to it. I may be inclined to squeeze in another 20-30k miles to capitalize on no monthly payments and pocketing the company reimbursement. 

For my next vehicle, I am leaning towards a brand new Model Y as kids will likely be part of the picture by then or shortly after. The elimination of the tax credit has me thinking should I just get the new car a year earlier due to the tax credit still being on the table? Essentially the credit washes my negative equity away as well as gives a slight discount on the purchase. But I’m also wondering if EV makers will end up reducing their prices or giving strong incentives to make up for the loss in the EV tax credit. I am still sour about Musk reducing the pricing on the M3 right after I bought mine years ago. Insult to injury is I bought that without the tax credit because at the time my income disqualified me but now I am engaged and plan to buy the car under my partners name who does qualify for it.

whatcarshouldIbuy,"Deciding on next car, weighing several very different options","I am looking to replace my 2014 Lexus ES350 that I have held on to for years while I saved up for a better vehicle. My wife & I make a combined 250k, we have no kids, no debt, only a cat. Live in the south east, don't carry passengers much. I am 6'2 however so I need a little bit more room.

I have always driven luxury vehicles and definitely prefer some of the modern luxury amenities over sportiness, to a degree. I also do greatly enjoy my driving experience, but I get similar satisfaction from being super economical. I don't really like SUVs and the largest car I would consider would be a crossover. That being said, I like big sedans. Budget is 80k. Reliability is fairly important to me as I have had Mercedes in the past that have drained me and I am not looking to go down that road again. I do love my hybrids as well. I am not looking to get into an EV as I do frequent 600+ mile roadtrips and I would need something that has the capacity to handle that long distance without the 30+ min recharge.

Currently my list of contenders:

1.  2025+ Camry
        
     1. I love this new gen camry. The hybrid feels fantastic, doesn't feel ultra sluggish like a Prius, standard tech is great but I love that it has options to add most features I am looking for like ventilated seats, for instance. Reliability is also a big plus
2. 2023+ Crown
   1. Same idea as the Camry but the interior space feels miles better to me. I enjoy the roomier cabin, and I would be shopping for the MAX trim for the extra HP. Feels like a good middle ground of luxury/sportiness
3. 2020-2025 Lexus ES300h
   1. A better version of what I have. I would be looking for the ultra luxury. Interior finish is gorgeous, very economical, tons of room, and great reliability
4. 2026 Lexus ES350h
   1. I personally love the redesign and I love that it is based on the Camry's newer platform, as it takes everything I love about the 2025 Camry but improves it further. I do worry about model refresh first year headaches however, but greater power, great MPG, love the bamboo interior
5. 2021+ LS500h
   1. Boat on wheels, beautiful interior, quiet and smooth ride, hybrid only furthers this. Decent MPG, like driving a couch. Love everything about this car
6. 2020+ BMW M340i
   1. Great quality interior, love the iDrive infotainment. Driving experience is absolutely top notch, feels tight, responsive, and fast, all while being decently economical
7. 2020+ BMW 550e
   1. More cabin space, much higher power output, very economical especially when driving in town. Heavier than an M340i but I recognize I am doing more highway cruising than going on a track. I am not experienced with BMW's hybrids other than a weekend with a 2024 X5e that I absolutely fell in love with. Plus I love the B58
8. 2021+ Genesis G80
   1. I have never owned a Hyundai or Genesis product before, but the ride, sportiness, interior quality, and tech of the Genesis shocked me for the price point. I have no Genesis dealers near me, only Hyundai, so that is a potential concern, as is relatively unknown reliability, but on paper I really like this option

  
I have driven all these except the 550e and G80 and have loved them all for very different reasons. I get fun out of a vehicle I own in many different factors from the speed, agility in turns, economy, quietness, speaker sound quality, etc. hence why my list is so varied.

whatcarshouldIbuy,I know essentially nothing about cars,"I just got my first real job a few months ago and I’m now having to actually start thinking about what car I want to buy. I’ve never really had to think about this before because I just needed a car to get to and from work, but now I have specific needs.

I know this is a long list and I can’t get everything, but I’d just like suggestions on where to start looking. I’m currently kind of interested in something like a Subaru Forester, but that’s about the closest thing I’ve found to getting everything I want. 

I currently drive an F150 for work, as well as my girlfriend’s 4Runner for everyday stuff and travel. I have also previously driven a Honda Odyssey.

I’d like something more fuel efficient for our everyday stuff and longer travel where we aren’t towing anything or car camping. 

We live in Washington state and are very outdoorsy people, I often drive down rough/steep dirt or gravel forest service roads so I’d prefer something with full 4WD, but AWD would be ok as well. I definitely need one of the two, as driving here even on normal roads in the snow without it can be dangerous.

I am also restricted on size lol. I’m 6’5” so I don’t fit in a lot of smaller cars, especially if the seat doesn’t move back much. 

Like the title says, I don’t know much about cars but from my family and friends I get the sense that American cars nowadays are kind of garbage. I’m not ruling them out entirely since I’m just looking right now, but maybe a slight preference for non-American cars. 

Any suggestions will help me at least know where to start looking lol

Thanks!

whatcarshouldIbuy,Lessons from first time solo dealership experience,"Alright before getting into the car buying experience I want to provide a little background on myself. I am 23 and have been financially independent for a couple years now. I have purchased two cars using craigslist as a teen and last year I bought a CPO Kia Soul from a dealership but my stepfather accompanied as he was co-signing (helped me get a better interest rate due to my short credit history). Unfortunately while en route to my wedding this past May some psychotic driver in Birmingham essentially pit maneuvered me causing my car to roll twice and land upside down on a guardrail totaling that car (which I loved btw). 

Now, my point with this exposition is that when I purchased my 2021 Kia Forte GT-Line last Monday from an auto dealership near my apartment on Long Island, it was my first experience purchasing any vehicle from a dealership by myself. As a result of their tactics and admittedly my own behaviors/lack of knowledge I ended up getting a bit of a raw deal and while I cannot recover any of my money I can share the story so hopefully it serves as a learning experience for more than just myself. Now for the past couple of weeks I had been scouring sites such as carguru, cars dot com, etc looking for good deals. I wasn't set on any specific models but I did know I wanted a CPO and I had a price, mileage, and year requirement. I ended up finding a CPO 2021 Kia Forte GT-line in a color I loved and with features I loved for a sticker price of around 14.5k (funnily enough the day I came to the dealer they had lowered the price to 13.5k earlier in the day which is the price I got). I did make sure to read the fine print and find the listing on the dealerships website because as I am sure many of you know dealers will list cars on those aforementioned sites and have conditions such as needing to finance through them, needing to pay some stupidly high reconditioning or other hidden fee, etc. Fortunately, though as I will share later this dealership had plenty of frustrating practices, they were actually quite transparent in this regard and did honor the sticker price with no difficulty.

I suspect my first mistake was getting dropped off at the dealership by a coworker due to not having a car (and Long Island having pitiful public transit when going north or south). While I am not positive, I suspect the salesman quickly recognized how much of a pain going back and forth from the dealership would be and thus pegged me as someone who would want to finalize a deal quickly. The salesman was overall quite nice and respectfully, we quickly did the test drive and he asked me about my opinions of the car to which I didn't say much mostly out of social awkardness. Anyways, we get back to the dealer and faster than I would've thought possible he has a sheet with numbers in front of me trying to get me to sign. I was admittedly overwhelmed by this particularly when combined with his more or less badgering of me to start signing paperwork as it made reading and comprehending the language of their paperwork quite challenging. I consider myself a fairly intelligent person and I think this was frankly also a mistake. I think these dealerships and salesman are very good at tricking a buyer into feeling like they are in control while also outmaneuvering them. I asked about a couple random charges like why they would be charging me for gas, what this VIP service is, and what in the world the 1295 charge for StarGard was. The salesman somehow managed to effectively wave off my questions explaining that the StarGard was added to all cars all over and was just a standard cost that couldn't be removed/altered and that the VIP package was a steal as it gave me free service, car washes, and other perks for a year. 

My absolute biggest mistake was not walking away at this point and really considering what I was purchasing/doing research into these add-ons. Now I wasn't being entirely stupid as I did contact my insurance (USAA) and asked them what sort of discount I would get by adding this StarGard to which they explained that the discount would be 33 per month and thus the savings would exceed the cost of the StarGard after 3.5-4 years. The salesman kept insisting that I sign this form on the cost but said it wasn't binding it was just so they could get moving forward with figuring out financing. I not only hadn't understood that certain things like the StarGard were negotiable (ironically I tried to negotiate not getting charged for gas because that seems obnoxious but they would not budge), but also hadn't understood that signing this form significantly hampered my ability to negotiate further. This ties into another big mistake which was not forming a negotiation plan beforehand. I should have considered what I wanted to negotiate down to prior to entering the dealership particularly since I very much struggle with that kind of social interaction (though admittedly I was pretty happy with the sticker price so the main thing I regret not negotiating were the various add-ons). 

Finally came the financing. I had actually tried to secure pre-approval but due to my lower income (47.5k per year) and good credit (753) but short credit history all the nearby banks were offering pretty poor rates. In my head I had 7.5% as an absolute upper limit and before we got to the financing step I kept inquiring about this and the salesman kept saying that there was an order to things and we could not discuss this until I signed that aforementioned form and met with the finance person. Well I end up doing that and she immediately starts trying to get to sign the paperwork purchasing the car. At this point I was frustrated and said I would sign nothing until we discussed the interest rate. She seemed surprised and told me it was 7.5 strongly implying that she thought I had already gone over this with the salesperson and agreed to it. Given the offers from other banks I did end up agreeing with this though this pivots to my next big mistake which was not seeking that pre-approval from a local credit union. I am fast forwarding a bit but the other day my local credit union offered me a 5.7% rate so I will end up refinancing through them but I should have had that number in my hand when I went to the dealership. Finally, we discussed the warranty options with it being a CPO and that all went fine as I knew in advance exactly what I wanted on this front (since it was Kia's offerings rather than the dealer's I was able to research it ahead of time). I did agree to purchase the 5 year extension on the bumper to bumper warranty thus pushing its expiration from 2026 to 2031 primarily because I know there are known issues with the transmission and engine reliability on some Kia's and I wanted the peace of mind especially since my job is highly time demanding and thus I don't want to have to deal with those sorts of failures without said warranty. I turned down everything else though as I had worked out some math and decided the rest seemed less financially sound especially given the value of the vehicle. 

Finally, my last mistake was not insisting that I get two keys/even asking about it. I hadn't really thought about this issue as with my last Kia purchase the dealership (that dealership last year was much less snakey but they are in Michigan) automatically gave me 2 keys. Turns out Kia does not require this for CPO vehicles and my emailed questions about it since purchasing the forte have been ignored.

Overall I realize much of this experience was my fault but I think it is important to highlight how effective dealerships can be at separating people from their money and more importantly all the pitfalls that a potential car buyer should avoid. For me the biggest thing is that I should have checked local credit unions with financing (this is not a huge issue for me as I made a large downpayment so my finance costs are not as big as I assume most people deal with), I should have been more aggressive with negotiating particularly insofar as the add-ons are concerned, and most importantly I should have been more willing to walk away when things started feeling weird. Not necessarily a mistake but I do wish I had entered that dealership with someone such as my wife (she is in DC for medical school though we did discuss this whole purchase in person the weekend before and agreed on a maximum amount of money I could spend) or another family member as I think it would have been good to have a sounding board and some backup when it came to negotiations. I know this was a very long read especially compared to other posts on this sub but hopefully this experience is interesting and/or informative to others.

Of course the dealership tried to pressure me to make a deal today, but I have no clue if it’s a good deal. I don’t think there’s any additional warranty or other stuff thrown in.

whatcarshouldIbuy,"Looking for a new car to move cities + start my first post-grad job with. Not huge car guy (yet), so any advice helps!","I am looking for something (used) that primarily gets me from a to b with solid reliability, gas mileage, and is under 20-25k, and has 4wd. I am 6'5, 200lb at 23yo so I was initially looking at something bigger like a 4runner or highlander (i also enjoy camping, etc) but realized those didn't make much sense since I don't have a family and wouldn't be off-roading anywhere close to enough to justify a 4runner, not to mention the gas mileage. As i've researched a bit, I realized there is plenty of leg room in much smaller cars as well.

Currently I am in a 07 Acura MDX w/ 160k miles that was inherited from my grandmother, and I do like the size but could definitely go smaller since that is pretty big, especially for 1 person. I'd say something in the compact SUV size. A few that I've looked into a bit are the RDX, RAV4, and maybe Mazda CX5 (my sister has one and seems to like it). I also considered smaller like a Camry, or even like a Honda fit or Focus ST but those are probably too small. 

I'm pretty fresh into this process so don't know a ton (I haven't been that into cars previously), so I haven't gone to sit in anything or look in person yet, which would obviously help my decision making. Just wanted to ask advice to narrow things down before I start looking. If anyone has suggestions that I haven't considered, those are definitely welcome as well. 

ALSO, if anyone has advice for overall car maintenance and ownership, or things I should keep in mind, that'd be great too. I want to do better to be more conscious about maintenance than I have in the past, and learning about this stuff is honestly more fun than I anticipated.

With the ac on there would be a noticable ""hissing"" sound and it would disappear after about 10-15seconds after turning off the ac. There was also quite a bit of rust under the door and in the corner of the sill and inside of the door. Also the back wiper would fall off.

whatcarshouldIbuy,No longer want Mercedes OR BMW.,"Trying to figure out which car to get. I am miserable. I just bought a CPO 2019 GLC Coupe AMG 63s. I own it. I have the title. The problem is I haven’t gotten to drive the car. I bought it in January- it’s been in for repair 13 times, starting with the second day of ownership. It’s an absolute lemon plagued with issues. The dealership can’t fix it it seems. I’ve taken it to multiple dealerships. Mercedes offered me only 4500$ off a new one and said “I should have bought a new car instead” (corporate, not the dealership) I am into this car for over 65,000$ at this point. CPO was supposed to be reasonably reliable I thought. 

I am going to try and sell my car somehow or drive it into the ground. I don’t know. I’m kind of screwed. 

I hate the new Mercedes models. I don’t want to spend 90-130k on a car that I don’t like. I don’t like the giant computer screens. I don’t like the hybrid motors. I don’t like not having buttons. I want something luxurious and really fast- I don’t care about body style or cost up to 120k. I prefer to spend under 90k. Even better if I can be under 65k. 

I REALLY want something with a good loaner program like Mercedes, as I drive 1k miles per week, and I have had a loaner the entire time I have been decommissioned. Would be even better if it seldom broke down. 

I can’t do Ford as they provide zero loaners- just  had one last year, took months to fix, still wasn’t fixed, I had no car since they have no loaners so I just was out of options. I had to borrow a clunker from a friend. 

I do not fit in Audi models I like, unfortunately. The seats are too big (my legs are only 23 inches long) my knee bends way before the seats end and I was barely able to get through a quick test drive.

Once a month or so, we might need the car to drive total distance of 60 miles.

I don’t want to spend more than $3800. (I’m not interested in the car’s resale value.)

These are the options:

- 2010 Nissan Versa with 107k miles for $3700

- 2003 Honda CRV with 172k miles (2.4l 4 cyl, automatic) for $3200

- 2006 Toyota Rav4 with 189k miles. (Has 2.4 4cyl, automatic, 4x4. Interior is cloth, power everything, CD, AUX) for 4500 dollars

I asked 6 different AI, and based on their ranking I should either get the CRV or the Versa. (They both scored 15 points in the analysis, but Rav4 scored 12)

So, what do y’all think?

PS1: I’m aware Toyota / Honda reliability cannot be compared to Nissan’s, especially with the CVT. 

PS2: also aware that the Versa shouldn’t even be mentioned in the same post with Rav4  and CRV… but while it might have cvt issues, it’s newer, has about 40% less miles than the other two.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Crazy Trucks/SUVs,"Hello everyone,  
  
I’m sort of in the market for a new vehicle and am curious what you all think. My new employer recommends a truck since I’ll occasionally have to travel to job sites with poor infrastructure, so offroad capability is important. I also drive to a very loose, unpopulated beach pretty often, so I would like to further emphasize offroad capability.

I’m a big car enthusiast, but most of my interest/knowledge is with VAG, GM, and a bit of Mercedes/BMW. The cool factor honestly matters more to me than reliability, which should become apparent below... I am also not afraid to travel for something rare and my budget is under $50k.

Some vehicles I’ve been considering:

* Late first-gen W463 G-Wagons (2014–2017ish)
* 70s Blazers/Jimmys
* First-gen Cayennes
* 90s AM General Hummers (Not sure if I am quite psychotic enough)

On the more practical side:

* Old Land Cruisers / GXs
* TJ Wranglers
* Silverado/Sierra ZR2 or AT4X (The used market seems to have cooled here, I see plenty under 50k)

I’m mainly just curious if there are any other cool offroaders I’ve overlooked, and I’d love to hear what you all would choose if you were in my situation.

TL;DR: Need a truck or SUV under $50k for daily driving, rough sites, and occasional soft sand driving.

Yes, I know that one is a full-size and the other is technically a mid-size. The Tahoe/Yukon is obviously bigger. But the Grand Highlander is surprisingly roomy. 

Where I do think the Tahoe/Yukon edges the Grand Highlander is in cargo space behind the third row. We do semi-regular road trips and being able to fit at least one full-size suitcase in the back along with pack-and-plays and carry-on size suitcases is a must. 

I can get a 2-3 year old Tahoe/Yukon with about 30k miles for around $49k. A 1-2 year Grand Highlander with <10k miles costs around $45k. So the Grand Highlander is cheaper.

We’ve never bought from a dealership but are needing to get her a new vehicle. Our situation is that I’m going back and forth between leasing a smaller SUV, Equinox, for 3 years to then ultimately buy a larger vehicle as our family grows. We have no kids at this time but assuming that will change in the future. 

The meat of the question would be, is it more beneficial to buy a used vehicle to carry some equity over into a larger vehicle or to lease initially and then bite the bullet of a larger down payment when we go to finance a car? With the new vehicle, we’d expect to have it for around 3-5 years depending on how quickly our family grows.

She was offered by our local Chevy dealer a trade in value of $7,000 (said the value is more like $5k and is ""giving us more than value"" so she can get under the $500/mo payment. They were trying to put her in a 2021 equinox with 50k miles for $21,500 sales price which I already found a better priced one an hour away, just unsure if they'd give us the same trade in and my mother in law doesn't love equinoxes anyways.

**What she needs in a car:**  
\- **Reliability** (obviously)  
\- Nothing huge, She lives on her own and only hauls herself and sometimes my wife and i around, which the compass did just fine doing.  
\- Car play  
\- A car that will be fine on road trips up to 8 or 10 hours

She **LOVES** Chevy blazers, but with her price point we'd be looking at 2020-2021 with about 40-50k miles, and i've heard mixed reviews about the reliability of those. **Would love people's opinion on this**

Other cars we've considered:  
\- Mazda Cx-5, Cx-50  
\- Hondas  
\- Toyotas  
\- Ford Escapes

whatcarshouldIbuy,2025 tesla model y vs 2022 BMW x4m comp,"I’m looking to get a new car and these are top two at this point. Looking for advice on what would be the better pick. I test drove both and they both have their pros and cons but it’s a hard decision. The Tesla long range rwd would be around 47k out the door. The main appeal for me is the fsd which I find to be really handy as someone who loves tech but it does add a 99$ month add on. The cons are high depreciation, build quality, Elon musk. The pros are fsd, cheaper out the door, lower insurance, saving on driving electric . The bmw x4m I’m looking for are a few and far between being a 2022 competition under 50k miles so I can get bmw extended warranty. Looking for a neutral color exterior with red interior with comp package and wheels. Have seen them but they go quickly and are around 55 to right under 60k out the door with warranty included. As an enthusiast I love the car but its cons are more expensive out the door, below average gas mileage, higher insurance, less tech. The pros are great build quality, s58 engine 503 horsepower, looks better imo, smoother ride. The original msrp is right under 100k.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Help me narrow down my choice further…,"Hi! I’m looking to buy a preowned car, but feeling overwhelmed. Here’s my criteria:

Top priorities: longevity, good city gas mileage, safety 

Type of car: sedan or hatchback (no trucks!)

Budget: 20k-30k (*may* consider new if it meets this)

Year range: 2020-2025

Fuel: traditional or hybrid (no full electric!)

Preferred brands: Toyota or Honda (feel free to pitch an alternative)

Location: North Alabama/Southern TN (USA)

For further info, I’ve been especially looking into Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, and Toyota Prius from the years listed above. Although Prius would admittedly have to be earlier 2020’s to meet my budget, probably. I’m trying to figure out how I can test drive and get a feel for different models at the research stage rather than the buying stage. I went to one dealership that bait and switched me and only let me test-drive a single 2023 Accord, because I wasn’t commiting to buying yet.",Toyota,1,0.67,2025-09-19 23:49:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1nl8u0i/help_me_narrow_down_my_choice_further/
whatcarshouldIbuy,"Need a unicorn vehicle that doesn’t exist, so down to 3 very different options","So I work in community health care and drive anywhere from 10km to 400km in a day, alone, on major highways, in town, or on rural roads. I also have 3 kids under 7, all still in convertible car seats. My PriusV has bitten the dust. I need efficiency during the work day, but it would also be nice not to have them all squished together anymore or be able to take a friend or grandparent somewhere too. But that’s not an everyday need. I’m down to a top 3 based on local availability in different categories of benefit and sacrifice. Do not come say minivan because I literally can’t get one quickly around here that fulfills other requirements., but please weigh in on the following. 

A seven-seater hybrid fulfills efficiency and people moving, but is bigger than I like to drive and expensive. The winner in this category is a 2024 hybrid Santa Fe for $43,000.

If I give up on the hybrid drive to save a bit on costs and have a slightly smaller turning radius, the winner is a 2023 Ascent for $37,000. Savings may be eaten up by gas costs after about 4 years relative to the Santa Fe, but a Subaru may by reputation cost less in maintenance, so hard to tell if it will be more economical in the long run. 

If I give up on 7 seats, the winner for a 5-seater hybrid is a 2023 Accord for $30,000 CAD. Much cheaper and even cheaper on gas, but FWD and still a bit squishy for 5 as they grow. I keep the same lifestyle I’ve had with my PriusV.

Im currently driving a 2021 Honda Civic Hatchback EX trim level, Im planning to sell it and buy an older car as I want to back to college and won't be able to work full time during school, I owe $16000 on it and according to KBB I should be able to get 19-21k for it. I guess first how realistic is that number? Second Im looking to be in the $5000-$6000 range on the new car. I want something decent looking and reliable mainly, but I'm not sure of specific models to be looking for. Im somewhat capable of doing work myself, basic maintenance things I can do and anything with a YouTube tutorial Im willing to do the work for. I was looking into an older mustang GT like the S197 as Ive heard they're pretty fun and reliable but I haven't found many options in my price range. I know a lot of people say Miatas are a go to cheap reliable car for younger folk, only issue is Im 6'3 and don't know how well I will fit in something like that but am open to test driving one and seeing. Also I want something fun and I would love to get a manual, the only catch being I don't know how to drive manual yet and everyone that I know that knows how to tells me just buy a car and force yourself to learn, being I'm in the market for an older car is this dumb considering I'm more likely to be harsher on the clutch? Im very open to any types of cars, trucks, hatchbacks, etc... The main things I have in mind are

1. Reliable

2. Somewhat Fun

3. Under $6500

4. Looks decent

  
The only things I want to add are a lot of people when talking about reliable cars say get a car with low miles, but from what I hear a low mileage car is different depending on the type of car and age, for example a 2010s civic low miles could be a bit higher than like an 2010s Audi's low miles right? Also what are the best sites and apps to look on for cheaper used cars, I know marketplace is big but am curious if there's any other apps or sites I can try.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Just bought a new Nissan Sentra. I honestly believe Nissan is underrated.,"$26K OTD for a 2025 Nissan Sentra SV Premium.

I pretty much finished signing a sales contract with my dealership on this one and will bring in a cashier’s check (cash payment in full) today and pick up my car.


The car has a sticker price of $27800. I haggled it down to $24000 after negotiating with 8-9 different dealerships. I just paid for the car plus taxes and title fees. I removed all those BS add-on packages from my contract when signing my name. 

I know people would probably say “Go Toyota not Nissan their CVT sucks”. But here’s what I think:

1) My family have actually owned a few Nissans and Infinities. We maintained our cars religiously. Most of the Nissans we own still run like new. No drama so far. For every 2010-2018 Nissan vehicle that has a failed CVT, I feel like there should be 20 that have experienced no issues. Post-2019 models are equipped with more reliable CVTs.
2) I tried to buy a used Toyota/Lexus first from used car dealers and was super close to reaching a deal. But this market is so volatile now. Prices are insanely high. (Trust me, a well-maintained 2021-22 Toyota Corolla SE/XLE with 37K miles on it will cost you anywhere between 23K and 26K OTD. My friend works with Mannheim Express. Auction houses are selling them for $20000-$22000 dollars before taxes and title fees Jesus Christ. 
3) Sentra is a mediocre line. But the SV premium is LOADED. I got everything I wanted: Bose sound system, 360 degree backup camera, dual climate control, built in navigation and speed alert, power seats with lumbar support, heated steering wheel and heated quilted leather seats, remote start and mobile app compatibility, digital mirror…literally EVERYTHING. At that price point, why not? Just name one other model from a different manufacturer that gives you all these features at a lower price point. You can’t.
4) I don’t plan to keep it after all the factory warranties on it expires. I just want to enjoy all those great features for 8-10 years and see how things go after that.

Taking all these factors into consideration, I honestly think  Nissan can be a great choice for some people at certain points.",Toyota,81,0.7,2025-09-18 18:51:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1nk64z9/just_bought_a_new_nissan_sentra_i_honestly/

whatcarshouldIbuy,"Need a used SUV that can tow 3,000 lbs+, hybrid would be a bonus","\* **EDITED** for clarity on September 19th at 11:00 pm \*   
  
I'm looking for a replacement for my 2016 Ford Edge SEL Ecoboost 2.0. I ended up with one of the faulty engines that are the focus of a bunch of class action lawsuits now, and of course Ford isn't doing anything about it in terms of recall. So it's scrap value, and as a result my budget is a bit limited. 

**LOOKING FOR**  
**Year**: 2018-2022  
**Budget**: $20k-30K CDN / $15k-22k USD  
**Body type**: SUV or possibly a station wagon  
  
**Needs**:   
• Towing capacity of around 3,000 lbs or above.  
• SUV, 2 rows is fine for us but if it has 3 that's ok.

**Wishes**:  
• Hybrid would be nice, but not essential.   
• A bit of factory warranty or extended warranty left/originally has a long warranty.

**Don't want**:  
• American makes. Every one I've owned has had endless problems. Done with it.   
• CVT transmissions. They're pretty iffy for towing with, especially through mountains.  


**ON MY RADAR**  
The following are my considerations so far, in order of preference. I'd love comments/feedback/suggestions on other makes and models I may be overlooking: 

**Toyota RAV4 (Adventure & Prime trim levels only)**  
✅ Tows 3500 lbs at these trim levels.  
✅ Smaller than many SUVs with this towing capacity, mileage decent when not towing.   
❌ Above my price range unless I go older and/or high mileage.   
🤔 Used, these trim levels go for as much as a used hybrid Highlander, in which case I feel like I should just go for the hybrid Highlander for the added space and then I don't have to worry about the gas savings.

**Honda Passport**   
✅ Tows 3500 lbs.  
✅ Seem able to get one for a bit less than a RAV4 or a Highlander.  
✅ A big smaller than the Pilot but a bit bigger than the RAV4.  
✅ I like the rugged feel of it.  
❌ Seems hard to find used.   
❌ Above my price range unless high mileage/older.

**Toyota Highlander (gas or hybrid)**  
✅ Tow 5,000 lbs but bigger than I need when not towing. Not a problem if I can get into a hybrid.   
❌ Above my price range unless I go older and/or high mileage.   
🤔 I'd love people's thoughts on which years are best for gas and hybrid models. It seems there are a number of years to stay away from with the Highlanders.

**Honda Pilot**   
✅ Tows 3,500 lbs and I've had good experiences with Hondas in the past.  
❌ As with the others above, a bit above my price range unless I go older and/or high mileage.   
🤔 I love Hondas and have had a Civic and a CR-V before that were problem-free so I have a soft spot for them but I don't feel like I ever see anyone towing with them, where I do see Highlanders and RAV4s towing. So I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing. They're rated for towing, and you can get them with a factory tow package. So...? 

**Hyundai SantaFe (2.0 or XL for towing capacity)**   
✅ This seems to be where I'm settling in terms of price point and features.   
✅ In budget.   
✅ Tows 3,500 lbs with the right engine/trim pkg.  
❌ Doesn't feel as solid to me as the Toyota and Honda options.   
❌ Doesn't have a great resale value second time around, but they make up for it in the purchase price.   
🤔 I was hoping to be able to get something in the 2020-2022 range and I'd be able to afford that with this make/model, and would have some warranty left on it, but it seems that the 2018 models of the Santa Fe have the best reputation of the more recent years for not having a lot of problems. So do I go with older/better reputation model year or newer/but known for more problems?  
🤔 I'm still stuck on when they first came to market in Canada and my friend drove a Hyundai Pony that seemed to fall apart if you looked at it sideways, but I know they've come a long way.   
🤔 Not my ideal vehicle but I have a couple of friends who drive Hyundais and like them so I'm feeling like this may be the compromise for me at the moment.

**Kia Sorento**   
✅ Tows up to 4,500 lbs depending on year and trim level.  
✅ Price point is decent, similar to Hyundai Santa Fe.   
✅ I could afford a newer vehicle than with the Toyota and Honda options, so hopefully less risk of buying a vehicle with issues/high mileage and better chance of getting one with warranty left.  
✅ Have decent warranty lengths.   
❌ Lots of discussion online about Kia being difficult to deal with on warranty issues, with lots of denied claims.  
❌ Feel kind of flimsy to me compared to Honda and Toyota options, even compared to Hyundai.  
🤔 I just have a negative image of them in my mind. I think if I'm in this range of vehicle, I'm more comfortable with the Hyundai.

**Mazda CX-9**   
✅ Tows up to 3,500 lbs depending on year and trim level.  
✅ More affordable for me than Honda and Toyota options.  
❌ I don't love the body style, but I could live with it.   
🤔 I wouldn't be able to afford the re-styled CX-90, so I'd be looking at the CX-9. The CX-7 and CX-5 don't tow enough.   
🤔 I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other with the CX-9 and I don't know anyone who drives one.   
🤔 I don't think I've ever seen anyone towing with a CX-9.

**Volkswagen Golf Sportwagen / Atlas / Tiguan**   
✅ Multiple models that would tow 3,500 lbs.  
❌ It seems like no matter what model and trim level and year I look at - Atlas, Tiguan, Golf Sportwagen - there are big issues almost across the board and the repairs and parts are pricey.  Even regular maintenance is more expensive than other makes.   
🤔 I really want to feel confident in VW. I almost bought a 2018 Golf Sportwagen at the beginning of my search. I test drove it and it was fun to drive; low mileage, great aesthetic condition. But then I started reading up on it and there were loads of recalls and complaints; turbo, transmission, water pump, the list went on.   
🤔 I would love it if someone could tell me the best year and trim level VW that could tow 3,000 lbs+ that I could trust, because I love the styling and they're fun to drive. But I just can't have another headache vehicle.  


**❓MAYBE❓**  
**Volvo**  
I do like the look of the **Volvo XC-90**, and I believe it and the **XC-60 and XC-40** can all tow 3,500 lbs at the right trim level, but I feel like parts and repairs would get pricey on a Volvo, and I haven't looked into their reputation and reliability yet but I feel like they're finicky. I seem to be able to find them in price range if I'm willing to back to a 2018. 

**Acura**  
I like the **Acura MDX** but I don't think I've ever seen anyone towing with an MDX and for the price point, I feel like I'd rather go with a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot or Passport. But I do like the look and they seem to have good reliability ratings.   


**❗️NOPE❗️**  
I can't look at **Subaru** or **Nissan** because they have CVT transmissions. Which is too bad because I love the **Subaru Ascent** and the **Outback**, both which have trims that could tow 3,500 - 5,000 lbs. And I love the **Pathfinder**, which can tow 5,000 lbs. But I'm not willing to tow over the mountains around these parts with a CVT vehicle. **Mitsubishi** also tends to use a lot of CVT transmissions, but in my mind they rank below Kia and so aren't a make I've really looked at.

There are a number of older (2010-2015) models of **BMW** and **Mercedes** that can tow 3,000 lbs+ and are in my price range, but I feel like I'm getting myself into a world of trouble buying one of these makes this old. Parts and labour on them are expensive. I don't see the need to open myself up to the headache. Same with **Audi,** and maybe to a lesser degree with **Lexus**. My money is better spent on a newer Honda, Toyota or Santa Fe, I think.

whatcarshouldIbuy,Help me make a reasonable decision.,"In the market for a new lease 0-1k down at most. 
Trying to keep monthly under 400.  l have a vw atlas  2022 sel r line that paid too much(750/mo) it was a pandemic lease when there was no inventory that is due at the end of the month and I have a long list of recommended maintenances that are pushing me away from buying it. 
For starters rotors and pads can run from 3k to 4.5k it got some bad shuddering coming down a mountain pass and they told me the rotors are showing slight bending, it was a scary ride and thr suv has less than 30k miles. The newer models have no attractive incentives and the only vw that has any real incentive is the id4 and there's no inventory in any of the dealerships in my city. 

Main reason I'm not buying is because got accepted to grad school and could really use the saved cash to pay for school instead of getting into debt with new student loans. 
 
Options are mostly phev  or ev  due to tax exemption going away craze and any dealership that wants to buy the lease I could use the positive equity  as down or just lose it by returning it. Only a handful of dealerships would buy it including VW but even going with a smaller Tiguan would see me paying more than any of the following list.

1. Jeep 4xe wrangler sport or Sahara (only because the upgraded sound system). Offers are really attractive probably can get me under 350 with 1k down . Just a rough ride coming from a city driver a lot of the entry levels have a tow hook kit and I bike reguarly, I put my bike inside of my trunk. 
2. Mazda cx90 phev - would be the favorite if it wasn't the worst rated phev of 2024 and not enough info on the 2025 model. Payment between 390-450 depending on trim and availability. I have had mazda in the past with great feedback. 
Evs worry me due to iffy charging availability in my apartment complex but could make it work out.  
3. Honda prologue  cheapest ev with 1k down I'll pay like 220-275 for a ex 270-310 for a touring.
(Could consider the Chevy blazer ev as it is the same platform but no inventory and no brand rebates)
4. Kia EV9  - any trim level is pretty , the most interesting vehicle  of the bunch but will take me out of 450  the wind model if any available I could probably get it for roughly 470. 

Other recommendations?

whatcarshouldIbuy,"Boy, it's tough out there","I had a 2016 Prius since 2017. Bought it gently used for $15k, financed it and paid it off within 6 months. Great deal, great car, but unfortunately it was totaled in a freak accident a few weeks ago. 

And somehow my insurance paid me...$15k. All I paid to use that car for 8 years was gas, maintenance, and a little inflation. Wild luck. I'm almost glad it was totaled.

So now I'm looking for a new car. I live in LA, work from home most of the time, but when I have to drive to clients, the drives can be long. So, what's important to me is gas mileage (definitely a hybrid), reliability, a comfortable cabin, and -- the one thing I hated about my old Prius -- low road noise. A touch of sportiness and/or ruggedness could be nice, but not at the expense of the above -- I'm coming from a Prius, after all.

I looked at used car prices, and holy hell -- they're so high that I'm actually looking at new cars because the difference in price just isn't that big. Researched like crazy and ended up back at Toyota -- it came down to a split between a new Prius or a new Camry.

I hate the Prius's interior (shame, as I love the exterior), but the Camry's interior is perfect (shame, as I hate the exterior). On paper, though, the Camry it is -- or so I thought. I wanted the XSE or at least the SE to add a *bit* of excitement to this thing, but pile on taxes and whatnot and suddenly I'm looking at $45k for a damn Toyota Camry. I about pulled the trigger until I had a moment of clarity and realized how insane that sounds. 

I thought about it and figured that a max reasonable price for my needs is $30k, and even that is pushing it. But anything in that price range just...isn't all that interesting, and if I'm going to be paying $30k for a car I don't even really like, why don't I search for something even cheaper? After all, life is only getting more expensive, employment isn't getting any more stable or easier to find if god forbid my business goes south, so why not just look for the cheapest car that fits the bill if I won't even really like the thing? From this point of view, the Camry makes zero sense.

Problem is -- from what I'm reading, 10 years is about as old as you want to go for a hybrid due to the battery. And due to the aforementioned insanely high used car prices, used hybrids within a safe number of years or miles are...nearly $30k. Sigh.

Add in the fact that I'd love to maybe take advantage of the nearly-expired EV tax rebates, but also lower interest rates were announced *today,* and also Toyota's 2026 lineups should be hitting dealerships soon such that maybe buying a 2025 will make more sense in a few weeks...and my head is spinning trying to find an optimal solution -- something worth buying for a reasonable price within a reasonable time frame.

Perhaps I seem like I'm over-thinking thing, and that very well may be true, so -- Reddit, what do you think? What makes sense to purchase here?",Toyota,126,0.88,2025-09-18 11:16:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1njymmy/boy_its_tough_out_there/
whatcarshouldIbuy,Comparing Engine of Same Model - 2015 Subaru Crosstrek,"Hi Reddit! 

While looking for a used car, I found two almost identical 2015 Subaru CrossTreks; one black and one silver. I took both for a test drive and the cars felt about the same. While the cars were still running, I popped the hoods and took videos of each engine. 

I wasn't expecting them to sound the same but I also didn't expect a big difference. 

For the black model, there wasn't any noise that raised any alarms for me. Meanwhile, for the silver model, I heard a ratcheting noise that definitely stood out. In the video, the noise becomes louder when focusing around the belt area. 

Does anyone know anything about this? Is it something to be concerned about?

I've attached a link that has both videos of each CrossTrek. 

Please let me know how each engine sounds in general and if there's anything else to be concerned about!

I discovered the Honda Fit and loved that it was compact while having so much cargo space and passenger legroom, things that were nonexistent in the Mini. I test drove one and I liked the handling since it reminded me of the Mini, but I really didn’t realize how slow it was until I got behind the wheel.

After complaining to my friends, they recommended that I look into a Golf GTI. I was immediately hooked, it basically combines the fun and sportiness of my Mini with the practicality of the Fit. But there’s one big issue: reliability. I’m afraid if I go with the GTI I’m just shooting myself in the foot by going back to another unreliable car. I’ve heard that a lot of the kinks were sorted out with the Mk7.5 GTI.

Well, that never happens and yesterday morning my sales guy calls me and says our auto body contact is statìng there is minor hail damage and it’s too many dents to fix. He is quoting the dealership $700 to fix but it’s normally a $4k job. 
I end up driving to the dealership to get clarification and the dealership may approve the repair BUT only both sides and the back. No mention of the hood and they said no to the roof. I looked on the roof top and at an angle you can see little minor dents but this wasn’t being touched . 

Am I wrong if I’m not mistaken in the “We owe you” contract , it states they will fix scratches and dents . No specifics. From what I’ve researched and understand , in the state of Texas , doesn’t the dealership have to repair ALL Damage??? If it’s more than 6% of the value of the vehicle ?

askcarsales,Need Advice Negotiating 2025 Kia Sportage X-Line AWD in MA,"I’m shopping for a 2025 Kia Sportage X-Line AWD in Massachusetts. The dealer gave me this quote:

• MSRP/retail listed at $35,360 (their number)
• “Adjusted price” after $500 rebate: $34,860
• Taxes: $2,209.94
• Doc fee: $499
• Registration: $170
• Down payment: $10,000
• Amount financed: $27,738.94

Kia’s official MSRP for the X-Line AWD is about $32,290 (plus destination), and KBB shows fair market value in that same range. An experienced dealer told me I might be able to get 7–8% off MSRP under the right conditions.

Any tips on how to negotiate this deal down? Should I push them to drop the “extra” above MSRP or waive the doc fee? Should I forgo the 0% APR for more cash off? I’m ready to buy this week with excellent credit but want the best out-the-door price.

askcarsales,Another reason F&I pushes their products so hard...      Calif.,"True story. I was the GSM working for a single-point, family owned dealership. The owner was also the acting GM, and we had a great working relationship.

One day he called me into his office and told me to shut the door behind me.  Not a good way to start a conversation, but it turns out it wasn't about me.  He pushed a check across his desk to me. It was for $300,000 and it was made out to him. Not to the dealership, to him personally.

""Do you think I will have to pay income tax on that?"" he asked.

""""It's coming from a company, so it can't be a tax free gift, you probably have to declare it"".  I'm no tax specialist, but I know a bit about how the IRS works.

""It's not a gift. It's a loan. They tell me I do not have to pay income tax on a loan"".

He could be right about that. ""Elaborate please?"" I asked.

"" The company wants me to stop selling (brand) warranties on new and used cars, and start selling their aftermarket warranty instead. The cost per warranty is less than the factory warranty, so it shouldn't be a difficult sell, and we make more money per.""

I'm not a big fan of non-OEM warranties, but I waited for the rest of the explanation.

""I pay the loan back by adding $100 to the cost of each warranty that we sell. Once we sell 3000 warranties, the loan is paid back in full.""

I did a mental calculation on that. It would take about a year and a half to sell 3000 at our current volume and warranty penetration. Jeez, and he gets to pocket $300,000 tax free.  At this point I'm in over my head about the tax repercussions. ""Best to talk to your accountant about this one, but it might make sense"".  I wanted to add ""and how can I get a cut of that action?""  As it turned out, I got a nice bonus every month for the next year and a half if warranty penetration was above a certain percentage.  A NICE bonus.

Now imagine the dealership getting similar ""loans"" for GPS/Lojack,  Paint sealant, GAP, etc etc etc.  Yeah, the rich get richer, and somehow evade the tax man as well.

Work for a big auto group, not a family held one?  Just multiply the numbers by a factor of what, 10?  20?  100?  And the money goes to corporate execs.  It's a fancy, tax free kickback.

askcarsales,Can anyone help me price my car?,"Hey everybody, im sorry if this not a post that belongs here, but every other sub points to this one or other subs like this one.

Im a proud owner of a 1993 Honda Accord V CC7 with 2.3i SR engine (H23A3) i bought the car last winter for roughly 1500€. i recognize this is way below for what the car is worth, as the previous buyer said he could not afford to keep a 2nd car around.  
  
It has power windows, power steering, electric sunroof, WORKING AC, parking sensors (i sense these are aftermarket but they work) electrical radio antenna and everything works flawlessly. I just done a big service which consisted of new timing belts, new rear muffler from TurboWorks, new 16'' BBS RX238 rims with new paint and brand new MOMO M300 toprun sport tires. i also have a spare winter set with OZ Racing Elegances with allyear Yokohama BluEarths. the car has gone 189 000km and is about to hit 190. It was never driven in winter and garage kept apprently all its life. even now im storing it in a heated garage as i dont wanna ruin it by driving it in the winter.   
  
The car has 0 rust underneath, which is very suprising for such an old honda it has new rear springs as the old ones were knocking, new window washer fluid pump and prolly lots of other details i already forgot... 

The car is babied, only runs on premium gas here in the EU which is 98octane or more and is babied.

The only known flaws are as follow: the oil pan is greasy, there is no leak but its not sealing well anymore which i suspect could be the issue of the engine with which i bought the car, that it is ""eating oil"" at a rate of 1L for 5000km. There is also a little hole in the resonator, that causes a slight whistle on acceleration as the new suspension caused the car to be a lil lower than it is from factory, but hey i got it with the car for free so i cant complain. I have not driven the car that much yet. it was a short distance daily driver and it recently moved me 1500km in one day without stopping. Oh and the car could use atleast a new clearcoat.

my question is how i should price this car? finding an example anywhere close to mine is near impossible in the EU. they are either weaker engines, diesels, facelifts, automatics or more poverty spec. I dont factor in the UK market, where they were made, as my car is LHD and not RHD. Below are attached pictures of the car and i would love if anyone can tell me more about what it could be worth as im trying to sell it to buy a BMW E38 750i with a V12.

askcarsales,Why would they let me go so easy?,"I leased 5 brand new F150s (2007, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2021) from the same dealership, bought out a couple of them after the lease term then traded in a year or so later. Bought tons of accessories at the dealer, did all maintenance at the dealer, bought add on paint and detail packages. I thought I was a great customer building a lifelong relationship like my grandpa had with his Oldsmobile dealer. 

I never once got a phone call to come down for a hotdog and Coke, Oldsmobile dealer called grandpa every 6 weeks or so to stop in for a doughnut or nachos on customer appreciation day.

Looking for a 2024 to buy or lease I went in and asked to drive a lariat F150. The sales person said they can put leather on an XLT for about $2k. I said I want a Lariat and willing to wait if they didn’t have one. She offered leather on an XLT again, so I thanked her for her time and left. That dealer has never heard from me again and I’ve never heard from them.

Sales people came and went over the years but I saw just enough behind the scenes to know that they had software tracking every call I ever made and every dollar I spent (at the dealership), which was a lot. 

Why did they let me go so easy? I think I got fair deals every time but not great, so they had to be making money. I didn’t negotiate ever, it just tell them I’d check back to see what rebates were like in a month or so if I didn’t like the price, we’d usually make a deal eventually, seems like a win for both sides. 

TLDR- disappointed that I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at the same dealer in about 10 years and they let me walk away. I would have come back for a warm hotdog.",,182,0.79,2025-09-19 02:01:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1nkh3wd/why_would_they_let_me_go_so_easy/
askcarsales,How to do this…,"Full disclosure—I haven’t bought a car since 2017. But need something bigger at this point so husband and I are looking at buying a hybrid mini van. 

I live rather rural and that just doesn’t exist here so I’m going out of state. I am not financing, just paying cash so have a very set max $ amount.

I’ve hit a few dealerships that I called and the internet price is inclusive of the tax credit though it’s not mentioned in the price. OR the internet price is only available if you finance or trade in. (That one was interesting because of the requirements of those credits, the vehicle didn’t actually qualify and/or it wouldn’t make sense to do so. Finance 30k when the car is under that, and trade in 3 model years or newer with under 50k miles… when the car for sale is older and more miles) 

But really the biggest issue is NOBODY is willing to give an out the door cash price without being in person. I know they will not take taxes or registration. So I just need to know what the dealership needs to be paid.
Is that norm? I’ve explained I will be flying in from out of state and cannot just swing through and they still do this back and forth. A few wanting me to fill out the credit application “to make sure they have something I can afford) and another I’m going on 5 days of emails and still no firm price besides “the final price will vary based on a few factors and with negotiations we prefer doing this in person but the list price is $19,891.”

So how does one even open a door to negotiating if they won’t talk numbers via call or even email unless I’m open to financing.

And second - let’s say I see an internet price of 20k. Major dealership. Dealership listed the car 24 days ago. I’m willing to buy at the 20k, but obviously prefer to save money where I can, is it feasible to offer like 5-10% lower? Or is that not a thing anymore?

askcarsales,"Bought a “safe and reliable” Toyota 12 days ago… now they want $5,100 for a catalytic converter?!","So… I think I might have just bought a lemon, and I’m furious/confused/sad/embarrassed all at the same time. I need advice — legal, car sales, negotiation, whatever.

Here’s the whole saga:

I bought a 2019 Kia Niro LX hybrid less than two weeks ago from a Toyota dealer. 103k miles, listed at $13,995 but they’d been slowly cutting the price down by a few hundred dollars at a time over the last few months until it was finally at $10,765. I thought I was getting a deal on aging inventory. I even told myself: “Okay, you know hybrids have a 10% chance of needing a new battery within the next 100k miles. That’s a risk you’ll take.”

But what I didn’t anticipate was the check engine light coming on after only 90 miles of driving. (I was out of town for 5 of those days, so we’re really talking just a handful of local trips and the 35-mile drive home from the dealership.)

I get it scanned, and it throws P0420 — Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1). Basically, it’s saying the catalytic converter is failing.

So I call the dealership. They ping-pong me between sales and service for two days until I finally drop it off Friday morning. At 3PM they call me back and go: “Yeah, it needs a new catalytic converter. That’ll be $5,100.”

Excuse me?? I’ve had this car for less than two weeks.

Sales tells me they can “help me out” and discount it to $4,800. Then service calls back and says they can maybe do it for $3,900 if they order the part from somewhere else, but it’ll take longer.

At this point, I’ve gone from sad → shocked → angry. I told them flat out: I’m not paying for this. You sold me this car, this is obviously a pre-existing condition, and you need to fix it.

Their response? “We’ve already helped you twice.” 

Oh, and about warranties. This part is rich:
I technically have three warranties on this car (Toyota Limited Powertrain, Toyota Extra Care, and Toyota Gold VSA).
BUT… none of them are valid for the first 30 days.
AND… even when they do kick in, emissions components like the catalytic converter aren’t covered.
So somehow, I bought a car with three warranties, and none of them protect me from the one repair I now desperately need.

I’m also in California, which means the dealer had to smog the car within the last 90 days to sell it. I’m going to check the paperwork, but if it passed smog that recently, how is the catalytic converter suddenly toast?

Meanwhile, during all this, I tried to push for a rental because the car isn’t safe to drive with the check engine light on. They included 30 days of “free insurance” with the deal, so I thought I’d be covered through that. Instead, I got passed around departments for hours until, at 6:45PM Friday night, they handed me keys to some random new Toyota off the lot and said I could borrow it for the weekend. (But if someone wants to test drive it, they might come take it back from me?! I live 40 miles away!!)

I can’t tell if they were just trying to get rid of me before the weekend or if this is normal.

So here I am, carless, confused, and absolutely livid. This was supposed to be the safe, smart, reliable choice. I researched for months before pulling the trigger because I trusted Toyota. I thought I was buying peace of mind. Instead, I got a $5,000 repair bill on day 12.

Independent mechanics have quoted this job at $1,500–$2,500, which is bad enough, but I feel like the dealer should eat the cost entirely. This was clearly an issue before I bought it — not something my 90 miles of grocery runs suddenly caused.

Do I have legal standing here? Better Business Bureau? Lemon law? Small claims? Or is this just “how it goes” and I’m screwed?

I just know one thing: I’m not paying a penny for this. I want to see the inspection report from before they sold me this car. And I need to know what to say to the GM on Monday when I escalate.

Please — give me your best car sales advice, legal advice, consumer protection advice, or just tell me how mad I should be. Because right now I feel like I’ve been completely taken advantage of, and I need some ammo before I go back in there.

Quick clarification: I bought a 2019 Kia Niro hybrid from a Toyota dealership’s used department. It wasn’t a Toyota-branded car, but since it came from their lot, my assumption was that Toyota inspected it, deemed it up to their standards, and put their name behind it. Someone probably traded it in while buying a Toyota, and I trusted that the dealership wouldn’t sell me something with major issues right out of the gate.

askcarsales,Why are finance managers part of the sales process in the US?,"If this is the wrong sub for this, please let me know where a better one might be.

I've bought a few cars from new car dealers in my life. I get that if I am choosing to try and pay less than sticker price, I should expect a negotiation. That all seems reasonable. Like the rest of humanity, some sales folks dealers are high pressure, others aren't. I don't love every part of the process, but folks gotta make money and I feel like I started negotiations by wanting to pay less than sticker, so can't really fault the dealer for negotiating back.

But one thing that has always stuck out to me as off putting is the finance manager as a place to upsell. By the time I get to the finance manager, I have been very up-front with what with my sales person and focus on out-the-door price. The sales person knows whether I'm financing or not, leasing or not, trading in or not. There should be no surprises for the dealer how much they're making on the deal. I'm paying cash? Gotta sit with a finance manager and hear a pitch about fabric protectant. Doing a factory 0% financing with an incentive that helped the dealer get to the agreed price? Makes sense I'd sit with a finance manager for the loan but why is he or she upselling me on a warranty? I assume this role is incentivized to do this, but why does the dealership set it up that way in the first place?  Why not just pay a straight salary to someone whose job it is to finalize paperwork and deal with loan or lease particulars. That might have to be a high salary, amortize it across the car sales that month like other salary-only positions.   
  
If I get to the spot where I've got an agreed price with my salesperson and the sales manager thinks there's not enough money it in, just tell me. They have the cars, the get to choose how much they want to make on each one based on the market, incentives, sales targets, etc. I know that changes often, so my own sales person needs an approval, but..like if it's an approved deal, just stop trying to sell more.

How did this finance manager as 2nd sales person thing start?

Unfortunately I have a commute that would require me to have a very reliable car. So I was thinking of using what they’re paying me out for the car towards a down payment on a new car. 

I have pretty bad credit due to CC debt. Due to a certain situation about a year ago. Less than 10k

I understand that credit karma isn’t reliable but it says my transition / equifax scores are 543/532. On the Capital One app it says my fico is 602

I do have an auto loan in my history. A 48 month term for my first car that I paid off completely and on time between 2017 and 2021

I’m not going to get a crazy amount for the car bc it’s a 2012 and had 180k miles. 

My intention would be to get a basic trim Honda accord or civic. See if I’m able to put down 5k and get a 60-72 month term. If needed perhaps up to 10k down.

Another option I was looking into was a used  2020- 2025 civic or accord at a used car dealership or CarMax. Putting the necessary amount down. Maybe a 48-60 month term. 

I’m on track paying off my cc debt and have been on time. So I hope to refinance down the line under better credit. I do work a full time job with decent pay that I’ve been at for 9 years. 

Yeah so I’m wondering how likely I’m able to get a car loan in my situation. Thanks in advance for the advice

askcarsales,ChatGPT answer. Is it realistic ?,"BMW X3 2022, 75k km

Here’s how it plays out if you buy it today for $40,000, finance over 4 years, and sell after 2 years and 30,000 km:

———————-

If the BMW X3 is a 2022, the worst of depreciation is mostly done.

Scenario: Buy today $40k, finance 4 years, sell in 2 years (~30k km).

Depreciation:
	•	This 2022 X3: ~$40k today → ~$30–32k in 2 years (worst case $28k if mileage high).

Loan: 4 years, 6%, no down → $940/mo. After 2 years, remaining balance ~$19–20k.

Selling:
	•	Private: sell ~$31k → equity ~$11k
	•	Dealer: trade ~$29k → equity ~$9k

Total cost: depreciation + interest ≈ $11.5–12.5k over 2 years (~$500/mo), not counting insurance/fuel.

Bottom line: You avoid the worst depreciation, should have ~$9–11k positive equity after 2 years, and total cost is reasonable for a luxury SUV.",BMW,0,0.08,2025-09-20 06:01:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1nli6e6/chatgpt_answer_is_it_realistic/

askcarsales,need advice on buying a brand new car,"Here is a short backstory.

I am 22 years old and looking to buy a 2026 Honda HRV EXL. The current mspr is between 31k and 33k for this specific trim. I have looked into financing through my bank and while I do not have any account with any credit unions I’ve looked into the apr rates for some in Tennessee. I have already test drove it and really want to purchase it as I am currently in a 2009 Honda Civic Ex coupe. I’m not trading in because my car is 100% a beater. It drives amazing but looks horrible. Would it be best to finance through the dealership. I have never purchased a car through a dealership and when I test drove they tried very hard to convince me to lease instead of finance. My husband is planning on joining the air force and we will be moving quite a bit so I don’t know if leasing is the right way to go.

What kind of apr rate will be good, can I negotiate this?

My budget is around 30k with a 5k down payment. I really want my payments as low as possible just incase (between 400-500). My husband and I currently make around 50-55k yearly. Our credit scores are both above 740 Will it be hard to find a loan with a low apr?

Should I buy a used 2023-2024 honda HRV? (they are between 26-30k)

Should I get gap insurance through the dealership or through my insurance (progressive)?

I have no clue what i’m doing. I really want to try and negotiate the price but don’t want to sound uneducated when I go to the dealership. I don’t want to get stuck with a horrible loan because  my bank(capital one) is offering such a low loan (24k) because my debt to income ratio is too close.

askcarsales,Need advice: 2021 Audi A5 Sportback vs 2022 BMW 228i xDrive,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently cross-shopping two certified pre-owned cars and would love some outside perspective. I plan to keep whichever I buy for at least **3 years**, and I don’t plan on swapping cars anytime soon. I’m fine with higher mileage as long as the car runs well, but I admit the “near-new” factor is also appealing.

Here are the details:

* **2021 Audi A5 Sportback Premium 40 TFSI**
   * Price: **$27k**
   * Mileage: **50k+**
   * 1-owner lease vehicle, **Audi Certified Pre-Owned** with 1 yr/20k warranty
   * No accidents, clean history
   * Recent major services: spark plugs, transmission fluid, brake fluid, alignment, 2 new tires, front brake pads & rotors. Basically had the big 40k service already done.
* **2022 BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe**
   * Price: **$27k**
   * Mileage: **14k**
   * 1-owner personal vehicle, **BMW CPO**, with about 12 months/35k of factory warranty remaining
   * No accidents, clean history
   * Only routine oil changes so far (but that makes sense given the low mileage).

**What I care about:**

* Reliability and peace of mind for the next 3-5 years
* Total cost of ownership (maintenance, repairs, depreciation)
* How people perceive these cars (I’m in academia)
* I don’t mind paying for proper maintenance, but I don’t want a money pit.

**My read so far:**

* The **Audi A5** is the more stylish, premium feeling car, and it already had most of the big 50k mile service done. Downside: higher mileage and the factory warranty is gone (just the CPO coverage left).
* The **BMW 228i** is basically a “near-new” car with very low miles and warranty coverage. Downside: it’s more of an entry-level BMW, so it doesn’t have the same presence as the A5, and I’d probably face more depreciation.

I’m torn – the Audi seems like the “classier” pick, but the BMW seems like the safer bet for the next 5 years.

**So if you were in my shoes, which one would you choose? And why?**

Thanks in advance!",BMW,1,1.0,2025-09-19 11:03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1nktk5y/need_advice_2021_audi_a5_sportback_vs_2022_bmw/

askcarsales,AIO about a delivery not detailed and then told to cancel the purchase for not being happy.,"I just bought a used vehicle from a one price shop that I was paying in cash. I obviously did whatever I could to negotiate a deal as I always and continue to do. The guy was rude and much I don't need your sale type of guy, but I wanted the truck.

Upon livery I noticed it wasn't detailed nor things I asked to have done before after waiting 4 days. And one big thing was there was what I was told was dust and dirt but actually turned to be paint. He told me it was sitting outside and it would come off but didn't.
So I was like well this a condition issue because it's not in the same great condition as you sold it me on. He then said you know what, ever since I met you, you were trying to negotiate the price and get a better deal and that's not happening.

I was so pissed, because I felt like I was being called a cheapskate.

I wanted the truck cleaned but obviously didn't have time because they told me id be in and out on 30. The sales guy said no one was there and I had to drive back but leave in a dirty ass car.

He told me the detail manager wasn't in and I couldn't talk the gm about my situation and then was told you should cancel the deal. (Bro I'm pissed off because you didn't do your ONE job)

After telling him off I rand right up to a manager where I finally got the car half assed vehicle and an apology.  I wasn't even offered a cup of tea for waiting two hours.

We brought it up to the used car sales manager, and he was absolutely no help, lol. So we bypassed him and called the GM, and wow! Not only did he give us the full amount we paid for our car for a trade-in, but he also gave us a $2000 discount on another car we wanted!
The moral of the story is that not all dealerships are awful, lol.",GM,14,0.74,2025-09-18 06:56:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1njtbwz/not_all_dealerships_are_bad/
askcarsales,Question for a Ford Dealer - Lightning,"I am looking to take advantage of the EV Tax credit before the end of the month.  I am highly considering the Ford Lightning due to having a truck I would be interested in trading in.  But I had some questions for a current Ford Dealer I was hoping to get an answer too before I call the local guys.

1. I know they are currently offering 0% for 72 months on the 2025s.  I am specifically looking for a 2024 due to the larger discounts.  Does the 0% work on the 2024s as well to get them off the lot?

2. With a 2025 I believe you are able to also take advantage of the home EV charger install credit.  Does this still apply to new 2024 that are on the lot as well.

askcarsales,Should we complain about the car dealership sales manager,"My daughter (24 years old) and I went to a local Hyundai dealer to test drive a car. The salesperson was great in terms of showing us the features and she was interested. The pricing sucked and I told him so (not in those words). Then he got his sales manager, a french man with a thick accent. Right after my daughter told him that mpg, safety features and reliabiltiy were the most important features to her, he said ""You're a girl, you must like nice pretty things"". He was talking about body types of another car we saw at a Toyota dealer. We both shot each other the wtf look. I asked if men liked nice or pretty things? He also called her my flower which was cringy. When I started asking questions, he asked if I was her body guard. I said that I was in a way. I asked if he had kids and if he planned to help them with one of lifes big purchases. Needless to say, things went sideways.

askcarsales,"More AI/BDC, Less Internet Salespeople?","This definitely is not a post for lurkers outside the business.  Not that I care if you read or comment, but you may get in your feelins vis the internet. 

I was meeting w my buddy at my old Honda store (I am now Toyota - SoCal) and both our stores have had most internet salespeople quit or go to floor sales. 

My store has a DRT that shows discount, all taxes/DMV, otd price, soft pull for APR,MF, you can put your own rate in, etc.  OTD cost is within $200 of accuracy and we eat the cost if needed; Lease payments +/- $7.   People still ask for quotes and we send them the link to the DRT.  The people who wanted up-front discounts, transparency online, no adds or other fees (sorry about your doc fee is under $100 🙄) throw tantrums when they have to spend two minutes creating their own proposal.  Between these mouth-breathers and the “can you beat this” Michael Jackson community, nobody wants to do internet sales.  Now we just mainly have BDC who set easy appointments and let the AI battle it out with the mouth breathers and Michael Jacksons.  

Since we pay for Urban Science and can see when people in our CRM buy elsewhere, Toyota or other OEM, we know we are getting our fair share of the market, winning our back yard, strong CSI, and hitting monthly targets that keeps Toyota happy.  I never thought a successful store with happy customers and fed salespeople would have AI and 23 year-old women who fight all day over gross mechanics be the backbone of the store.  Also, whenever they get their commission check one of them always comes in botox’d the fuck up.  

Has your store had a shift in people who used to enjoy and thrive in internet sales essentially say “fuck this shit” and move to the floor?  I get it; I don’t want whether or not I can feed me family and pay my bills based on rude customers sending nasty emails and texts all day.

askcarsales,Buying from Small Used Car Dealership,"Hi! I'm helping my immigrant parents look for a used car, and we found one that we feel good about a small used car dealership lot. This is their first time buying from a used car dealer, so they’re unsure about parts of the process. I’ve been doing research online, but since I’ve never bought or owned a car before, it’s a bit overwhelming. I’d really appreciate any thoughts on these questions (sorry if I'm phrasing anything wrong).

* The car was purchased from an auction. The title document has a credit company as the title owner. The back of the document has an assignment to another company, then to the dealer as the first reassignment by a licensed dealer. We were told that we would be put in as the second reassignment by a licensed dealer. All liens are also clear. Is this all that the dealer need to provide after sale in order to properly transfer the title? Is this what it means to ""get the title"" to the car?
* The dealer said after, they would mail the title to us. It looks like in my state, the dealer is responsible for submitting the vehicle registration and title application to the DMV. So do we just sit tight and wait for that in the mail, nothing else we need to do?
* The name of the dealership is different than the one that shows up on Google maps (which has decent reviews). It seems legit, since we went into their office and the car was in their lot. Not sure if it's a space-sharing situation or if it's a red flag?
* Anything else we should double check before we commit?

I currently drive a 2014 Honda CRV. I have a ~40 minute commute to work and have to fill up on gas usually two times a week. For the next car I get, which is still a few years out, I’d really like to get an electric car - maybe a Hyundai, and definitely a sedan for mileage. 

With not needing to pay for gas, a quieter engine, and quicker acceleration(?), I’m just wondering - aren’t electric cars clearly the best option?? Am I missing some obvious downsides?

askcarsales,Toyota dealer confirms then denies availability of Corolla LE. He's now offering a Corolla SE. Is this an upsell or is he just looking out for me?,"A colleague who is an ex-car sales guy, highly recommended a colleague of his who he promised is someone who would take care of my interests.

The dealer messaged me to say that a Corolla Hybrid LE was available, when I asked to come over and meet him in the evening, he said the car had been sold by another salesperson. He said this was from a cancelled order and the ordinary wait time was 8 - 10 months. Then he reached out to me today to say that a Corolla Hybrid SE will be available in November. He wants me to come in tomorrow and sign on the deal, because it's their highest selling model and he's not sure how long he can hold it for me.

I'm not sure if the sales person is trying to upsell or if he is genuinely looking out for me. It's just that I need a car desperately to commute and the Corolla LE seemed like the best option. Being offered an SE so quickly after the LE cancellation makes me doubtful about what's going on. It's worth mentioning that I never told the sales guy what trim I wanted, only that budget was a constraint for me. And my colleague swears by him. If the wait times for LE really are that long, then I have no option but to buy it, but I'd at least like to have a better idea of what's going on.

-  My lease term is 3yr/36K however I am only at about 15K mi (waaay under mileage)
-  I love my MDX and would be happy getting another with similar package/bells & whistles, staying in similar price point for payments
- There are 4 dealerships within 45min of me, so shopping around is an easy option.
- i live in Philly suburbs if geography makes a difference

Is it better to start shopping now before year end, rather than closer to my lease end in march?

I am a vet and I am a NFCU member and I’ve heard there’s the small possibility (maybe less so with only a high 600s credit score) they’d do it but I’m at a loss of what to do. The easiest thing would be for someone to hit me and allow GAP to cover the difference but I have enough medical bills as it is. In theory, I could afford a Corolla or something cheap even if I paid 600-700/month for it for 3 years because I’d be out of that debt in a shorter amount of time and would still be making cheaper payments than I am now.

askcarsales,Am I about to get screwed?,"We bought a car a month ago. Test drove it and liked it but it had a few cosmetic blemishes and had been on the lot for a while and it was on special. We were comfortable with the price so moved forward. At no point was it mentioned there was an identical car on the lot with fewer miles and no blemishes.

Today, we got a call from the dealership manager saying they had “good news”. They had given us the wrong keys at the time of sale and were going to drop off an identical car with fewer miles today to swap with the wrong one. Explained it was necessary because all our registration paper work had the wrong VIN.

But because of the blemishes I know we have the car we intended to buy. And again, they never mentioned a second identical car which it seems certain they would have done due to our stated concerns with the blemishes that almost torpedoed the deal. 

Should also mention that after the sale we had to fight and argue to get them to repair one of the minor blemishes they agreed to fix. They accused us of causing the blemish after the sale even though it was clearly pointed out and discussed as part of the sale. So I don’t think this is a dealership that is going to do us any favors.

I can confirm the VIN doesn’t match our paperwork.

So my alarm bells are going off. Is something else going on here?",,0,0.5,2025-09-18 01:48:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1njlqib/am_i_about_to_get_screwed/

askcarsales,"Dealer promised car by today, now no ETA — am I being strung along?","I made a deal for a car last Friday. At the time, the dealer said the car could be here as early as today (Wednesday). Instead, I’m now being told they don’t know when it will arrive. They say they’re swapping the car with another dealer, but that the paperwork is “taking longer than usual.” The car is only 53 miles away.

I didnt have expectations because of it but i knew that he had to at least like the vehicle if i had any chance of him bringing his trade back. 

I was chill and answered whatever questions he had, made small talk about his business and found out i sold his daughter before so i was even more relaxed.

We got back i got a card, shot the shit, asked if he liked it enough to bring the trade in, got contact info and parted ways. I could tell that he had a pleasant time and i feel i made the most of what i had.

Now with that said, that voice in my head says i didnt try hard enough, i wasted my time, i wasnt determined to sell him today, a real salesman will ____

However it was a nice change of pace from how i feel ive been approaching which is this wall of “Are you possibly going to buy” aura. For example, typically i may have found out trade wasnt here and then i shut off. I basically make it seem like if they dont have the trade they werent really trying to buy so no point in putting too much energy in, just schedule them to come back”

Im not always so blatent about it but im conditioned to be a “buy today” person and that all be backs are lost. But that pressure on my self probably radiates to a customer and while i do good enough, i deserve to do great.

askcarsales,Salesperson misrepresented and coerced into buying a problematic car,"Location: Ontario, Canada

I was looking for a used car and came across a contact through friend's friend. This guy called me at the dealership and showed me some cars which I did not like, he proceeded to tell me he has access to auction through the dealership and his sales license and can show me options there. This person on my occasions lied about having an OMVIC license which I got to find out later, he didn't. Fast forward, 2 days later starts sending me photos and tells me a perfect car is up and bid has been closed, pushing me to participate. Next day came to my house asked to withdraw 4k cash and with a friend took us there, did not let us drive out of the small yard and had removed engine sign on the dash, also since we did not drive it out we did not realize the problems with its transmission slipping, but forced us to close the deal and made big promises if any issues come up he'll get the car sold for the same price. As soon as we left within 2 mins engine sign appeared and noticed transmission slipping, took us to a mechanic and told us he will take care of the car and get it sold, and disclose all the problems to whoever reaches out, did nothing and wasted a month, now after a month is refusing to do anything and telling me that I am harassing him and stop reaching out. I have chats on WhatsApp and call recordings as proof but no email exchanges.

Key findings - Not registered salesperson, was misrepresenting himself. The auction site he told us about was a regular sale yard and he had a contact he had told to pretend to talk to us as if we are in auction.

Other than phone number, email and name no other information is privy to me.

My legal question: Can I reach out to Small business court and fight my case on my own or would this case fall under some other category which can also be reported and can I file a report with the cops too?

Just looking for insights.

askcarsales,"Dealership lost my (new) car keys, have been lying to me throughout the process, what should I do?","I purchased a 2026 Carnival on September 5th. It was a dealer transfer, which I had done on my previous car, so I felt comfortable with signing the papers and getting everything squared away prior to delivery.  
  
The car came in on the following Monday, September 8th. They had to install a hitch and tint the windows, so they told me they would hand it over on Tuesday the 9th. On Tuesday I received this text: https://imgur.com/a/gl0IDSQ  
  
I went to the dealership that day because I couldn't believe a dealership would lose both keys to a brand new car, but I was told that it was all too common. I took a look at the van to make sure it wasn't them trying to cover up something, but it looked great.  
  
On Friday, 12 September, I called them up to check on status. The sales person I spoke to said that they would most likely get the new keys on Saturday, so I should have it soon. At this point, I just decided to enjoy my weekend and not worry about it until Monday. Yesterday, 15 September, I received this text: https://imgur.com/a/fz7Aydz  
  
I called them immediately because if they have the keys, why would I have to wait another day? I was told that the guy who can program the keys doesn't come in until Tuesday (today). I was pretty livid. From my perspective, they lost the keys, oversold how quickly it would be resolved while slow-rolling ordering new ones (should've been overnighted IMO), and then I find out they only have ONE person who can program them?  
  
I went to the dealership to speak with management, which was mostly a waste of time, but I did find out that the sales person has been lying to me the whole time. They hadn't even actually received the keys yet.  
  
So of the things I was told that are not really truthful:
A manager misplaced the key/They don't know who misplaced the key (this is largely irrelevant to me, I see this is as a management issue regardless of who lost the key)  
It would take 3 days at most. (We are on day 7, still no key)  
We have the key but can't program it today. (Flat out lie)  
  
The manager I spoke to looked like he could not have given less of a fuck. He just agreed with whatever I said about how poorly they've handled this and made various non-committal comments about the issues they've had with missing keys. 
  
I would've backed out of the sale but I've signed the documents and I figure it would just end up costing me more time and money to deal with it. But here I am, still without my car.  What should I do from here? I don't even know what I would want to ask them for as concessions, because I don't feel like I should ever step foot into that dealership again.",Ram,10,0.62,2025-09-16 20:35:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1nihogy/dealership_lost_my_new_car_keys_have_been_lying/
askcarsales,Car trade in troubles holding up delivery of new vehicle (Ontario Canada),"I recently purchased a new vehicle to replace my daily driver that decided to break down. The dealer offered $500 bucks for it and I decided to trade it in.

I told the dealer that I still had one more payment that had to go through before the old car was paid off, and they mentioned I’ll need to get confirmation from my the bank that issued the loan that the loan is paid before I can trade the car in. This was discussed before the deal was signed and financing was applied for, so I figured it wasn’t gonna be a problem.

One week later (today) the payment went through and the loan is closed. My bank will mail me a letter confirming this fact and it arrives in 2-3 weeks… 

I hate the idea that the brand new $35,000 car I bought is gonna sit on a dealership parking lot for close to a month over a $500 trade in.

Isn’t tag/title processing just a fee for the dealer doing the work of transferring for me? Even then it shouldn’t even cost $475 for the license/title. Was thinking like 200 at most.

askcarsales,Grounding lease early - Chrysler capital,"Redditors,

I am getting conflicting information on what I would owe if I were to ground the lease early

Background info: I have a car leased with Chrysler capital and I have 10 payments left. I was under the impression that I would owe all payments and their 495$ disposition fee

But then I spoke with the leasing specialist at the dealership, and he said in fact that may be much lower. He calculated about 4800$ or so… he said if I ground early I will save on sales tax for each of the payment and the interest

What has your experience been ? Any clarity on this situation would be greatly appreciated

This weekend my wife bought a gold certified car from Toyota. They just emailed her the 160 point inspection form and asked her to sign it and send it back. We have a couple issues with that. 

1) When in financing, the guy had to call to verify the latest recall was addressed by their shop because the acknowledgment of there being a recall form was in his stack of papers. Upon her getting signed up and registering her car with the Toyota app, it still shows the recall is present. 

2) The car had just arrived at the dealership that morning, we arrived at 2pm, and wasn’t even in the system yet. I’m not sure how long those inspections take, and where on the list I priorities it would be to be confident that it was completed. 

And then 3) I questions them because the whole section regarding EV/Hybrid features was checked off at “N/A”, even though her car is an EV. As well as checking the box saying the tires needed service/replacement, though they look and we were told they were new. Which makes me question anything on that form. 

From my understand it’s supposed to be inspected by the dealership right? Is it possible that form is from the last dealership that had it in its possession? What are the implications of not signing this form and pushing back on them, is that appropriate/ advisable?

Does anyone here have experience with TWS Warranties? I recently purchased a used 2022 Subaru Forester to replace my other Subaru that was crashed into. Used Forester I bought was a previous lease vehicle and had low miles.

Anyway, it was outside of the manufacturer warranty so I couldn't purchase an extended Subaru warranty, but the dealership had TWS Warranties which partners with Subaru. I bought the platinum warranty, but is this a dumb idea?

I have 2 weeks to cancel the warranty and it just costs me $25. Warranty was discounted ~$500 so it was just under $3,000.

They gave me the whole ""electronics"" speech about why an extended warranty is important, but I was more concerned from a mechanical standpoint because I've had friends with expensive repairs when something broke out of warranty (not Subarus but in general). I bought my previous Subaru new (2020) and never had any kinds of issues with it

We also are in a rural area where people are afraid of hybrids much less going into all electric just yet. Weve got them in but we havent had the demand for the manufacture to send more to us. But i do have one ev but its not a sedan.

Customer responded with a scoff “Well i dont need an education. I know i want EVs. So does that sign not say Hyundai up there?”

Yes it does. We are a hyundai dealership

“I just dont get it. I figured id buy a car today so im driving and i see a big Hyundai store sign and pull in and your telling me you cant even provide them for customers. I mean is this a real dealership? I shouldnt have to drive to another state to get one you should be able to get my business here”

askcarsales,Bought a car w/ a Ford Blue Certified warranty. It was in the shop within a week and the warranty claim was denied.,"Hi all! As the title states, i recently purchased a QX60 from a Ford dealership that included the blue certified warranty. Within a week, we noticed smoke coming out of the exhaust on startup and immediately called Ford who told us to bring it to an Infiniti dealership.

After a couple of weeks of being in the shop, they said it needed a new engine and sent pics of sludge buildup. The warranty claim was denied because of lack of car maintenance (which obviously wasn't my fault).

We called the dealership, sent them pictures, and now they're looking into it. What might happen next? Can I expect get any concessions or a decent deal on an equivalent ride since the car was misrepresented? I also had a trade-in (which has since been sold), so the deal can't be entirely unwound.

Just looking for some advice or a sales person who has dealt with this before as I've never bought a vehicle where the supposed 'warranty' was voided before it was even added!

askcarsales,22 started a new job please help!,"Hello! As title states I’ve started a new job. Posted a second time just for more advice since I’m pretty nervous. A little background, I’ve been in the business a year and a half, and just transferred over to the neighbour competitor. 6km away and being the same brand. 

My new dealer does at-least 10x the volume with 1 less sales rep, everyone sells 30-40 a month being 50-70% repeat/referrals. All in the business for decades. Then there’s me. They don’t expect me to compete at 30-40 units a month, but the goal is to. 

I first want to be a 20 car guy since I never was (old dealer sold 50-70 cars for 8 sales reps and I did 7-12 ish)

Maybe I’m too new to see what my new managers do, or I care too much and it’s blinding me with stupidity/anxiousness, but I’m somewhat scared. I’ve never been on this side of the fence. 

I feel sort of stupid writing this, since I don’t have a specific question in mind, but I really want to grow at this dealership. I truly think I lucked out on my situation. Any advice is greatly appreciated and will be practiced within reason. Please chime in!

askcarsales,Trading car for a older car with no payment,Wife has a 24 Crosstrek with 6k miles. We owe a little over 17k yet total price was 27k. We are thinking about trading it in we would get about 6k in equity and then buy a used Toyota for about 9k out right with no payment. She uses the car strictly for work and we use my 25 crv for all the family outing and car trips. Plan would be that I drive the used car to work (15 min drive) and put what her old car payment would be onto the crv as extra payment to pay that down quick along with any extra money we can to hopefully have that paid off by February 2027. Is this a good idea? Or should we just suck up the remaining car payments? I don't care about all the bells and whistles of a new car I would spend 30-40 mins a day in the used car so who cares. Also insurance would be a bit cheaper as well so that'd be another plus. Then our plan from here on our would be to just have one nice newer car for family time and then the crv will eventually replace the used one so on so forth.

askcarsales,Trade in with engine swap and,"I took my vehicle for routine oil change with a chain (Big O); oil leaked out 1 week later and engine seized;  they took responsibility and changed engine out with a used engine but refused to cover incidentals like car rental and dimished value saying it is a newer engine.  After a week another leak was found ; this time, engine did not seize but another major repair on the swapped out engine occurred.

In the meantime, I had to purchase a new vehicle while it was finishing repairs;  the dealership offered coincidently the “rough” value according to Edmund’s; a 6k diminished value compared to Edmund private sales.  I speculate that they pulled the carfax and saw a major engine swap followed by another repair of the swapped engine;  did they low ball as routine or were they justified in offering a rough value;  

The repair is done; I haven’t taken possession of the vehicle but I feel I have to sell it soon.  I don’t think it would be ethical to pass on a troubled vehicle to a private buyer and I also don’t feel it’s right to pass on a problematic vehicle to CarMax or carvanna?

My question is if the insurance paid let's say $15000 for the car (2020 Toyota corolla w/ 30k miles) would she get the difference in the amount since obviously 8000 would go to paying the rest of the lease?

askcarsales,This guy wants to buy my Accord but it seems a little sketchy. Advice?,"So my car died a few a days ago and I don't know why. It won't crank at all when I turn the key. The drive belt  tries to spin only once and that's the only movement it tries to make. The battery and the starter are still good. I replaced the spark plugs and ignition coils, cam and crankshaft sensors amd the EGR valve gasket but to no avail. Anyways, I have no interest in trying to fix it anymore. I had already decided a while back to buy a car in October, I just wasn't expecting it to break down right now. I was only hoping to get it running for another month. 

So now, I'm trying to get rid of it. I put an ad on Facebook marketplace and mostly out curiosity. I wasn't expecting to get so many messages within the first day. It's a 2007 Honda Accord 2.4 4 Cly, EX and I listed it as nonoperational for $800. I got a few offers for half and this one guy actually offered the full amount. Here's the thing, he's three hours aways from me. His first message was simply:"" Send me the address. I'm in <this city>. I'll give you what you asked for but I'm three hours away. 

Google maps says the city he's in is 2.5 hours away so he wasn't lying about that. It just seems a little sketchy. Three hours seems like a long drive for a car that doesn't even run. I messaged him back. :"" I just want to be sure you read the description. You'll really drive three hours for a car that doesn't run?"" He responded:"" I read the description. Just send me the address and I'll be at your house tomorrow. You have the title, right?"" I asked my friend who knows way more about cars than I do and he doesn't think it's unrealistic that someone would be willing to go that far for a 2007 Accord. 

Well, what do you guys think? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading. Sorry it's so long.

Edit: Hey, everyone. I want to say thanks to everyone who took the time to address my concern. I decided to cancel the deal, but for a different reason. I'm so stupid, but I didn't know that cars need a smog check within three months before selling. My car needs a new catalytic converter so it definitely won't pass. I swear i was honest about this fact in my ad. This is my first time selling a car, and I thought it was as simple as just signing the title and notifying the DMV. I feel bad wasting everyone's time. I recognize that it's most likely that most people who are interested in the car are going to try to flip, and I have no guarantee that they will notify the DMV within 10 days. So, for my own protection, I'm canceling it.

I was quite frustrated with carmax over that. I could have understood it if they found a problem or something, but they went through the inspection with me and literally everything was perfect on it.

askcarsales,"First time buying new, what do I need to know?","Hi!

So, long story short, I have an appointment to go look at a new ('25) RAV4 hybrid this weekend. I've only ever bought a car once before, and at the time had my heart set hard on One Specific vehicle (which had been discontinued some 7 years prior), so I've never been in a situation where I don't really give a damn about the specific vehicle, so long as it's the make/model I want. I also paid cash in that situation, so I've never had to deal with loans or financing. 

I have NO idea what to bring, how insurance works for testing vehicles, or even how the negotiations work (hand to god haggling is the bane of my existence and I am SO bad at it). Thus far the local rate for the LE RAV4 hyb is about $35,600. I found a dealership advertising at $32,600, so that's as far as I've narrowed it down. I have about 26k for a downpayment, and got a loan pre-approval for about 10k, and my trade in is worth about 3k give or take. 

Is it reasonable to expect to get 3k (kbb says 3.8k, edmunds says 3.2k) for my trade in or should I be more flexible? 

Is it reasonable to ask for the out the door price to be that 32.6k (I know with the fees that would kill about 1.9k off the asking price), or should I just expect it to be 34+k, since I know they've already applied a 3k discount right from the start. 

Thanks!!!

askcarsales,2013 Hyundai SantaFe Sport Limited or 2017 SantaFe XL Limited? Which one to buy?,"I am looking to buy a used car, and my budget is quite limited. I’m considering two options but am feeling a bit confused. Here are the details:

First Option:
2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Limited AWD - 5 Seater  
- Mileage: 120,000 KM  
- Engine: 2.0T Turbo GDi  
- Price: CAD $9,500

2017 Hyundai Santa Fe XL Limited AWD - 7 Seater  
- Mileage: 164,000 KM  
- Engine: 3.3L V6  
- Price: CAD $13,500  

I am leaning towards the 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe for a few reasons: it is more affordable (CAD $4,000 cheaper), has lower mileage, and is smaller, which should make it more fuel-efficient. 

Since we are just a couple, we don’t really need a large 7-seater car. However, I am still uncertain because of the differences in engine size and manufacturing year.

Decent beater truck.

Large Ford dealer nearby offered only the truck for $3k credit saying they already have a plow for their lot, while mandating $3k of additional charges on a new F250. Separating plow and truck is not a good idea since Fishers require a special mount and separate light, hydraulic controls. Plow is 700lbs+ so can't move it without truck hookup anyway.

I had a really bad experience listing vehicles on FB marketplace so don't want to do that again. I'm not asking for much: $8k for everything. Am I unreasonable? What type of dealer should I go to?
